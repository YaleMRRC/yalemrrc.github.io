The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is an ongoing, 
nationwide study of the effects of environmental influences on behavioral and 
brain development in adolescents. The main objective of the study is to recruit 
and assess over eleven thousand 9-10-year-olds and follow them over the course 
of 10 years to characterize normative brain and cognitive development, the many 
factors that influence brain development, and the effects of those factors on 
mental health and other outcomes. The study employs state-of-the-art multimodal 
brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, and careful 
assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and 
social functioning. The data is a resource of unprecedented scale and depth for 
studying typical and atypical development. The aim of this manuscript is to 
describe the baseline neuroimaging processing and subject-level analysis methods 
used by ABCD. Processing and analyses include modality-specific corrections for 
distortions and motion, brain segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction 
derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), analysis of brain 
microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI), task-related analysis of functional 
MRI (fMRI), and functional connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI. This 
manuscript serves as a methodological reference for users of publicly shared 
neuroimaging data from the ABCD Study.

Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across varying spatial scales 
in the mammalian cortex, but technical challenges have limited conceptual links 
between the function of local neuronal circuits and brain-wide network dynamics. 
We present a method for simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon calcium 
imaging of a local microcircuit and mesoscopic widefield calcium imaging of the 
entire cortical mantle in awake mice. Our multi-scale approach involves a 
microscope with an orthogonal axis design where the mesoscopic objective is 
oriented above the brain and the two-photon objective is oriented horizontally, 
with imaging performed through a microprism. We also introduce a viral 
transduction method for robust and widespread gene delivery in the mouse brain. 
These approaches allow us to identify the behavioral state-dependent functional 
connectivity of pyramidal neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing 
interneurons with long-range cortical networks. Our imaging system provides a 
powerful strategy for investigating cortical architecture across a wide range of 
spatial scales.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically collapse data 
from many subjects, but brain functional organization varies between 
individuals. Here we establish that this individual variability is both robust 
and reliable, using data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that 
functional connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately 
identify subjects from a large group. Identification was successful across scan 
sessions and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an 
individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish 
that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. 
Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but 
the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show 
that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same 
networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive 
of cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about 
single subjects on the basis of functional connectivity fMRI.

Neuroimaging is a fast-developing research area in which anatomical and 
functional images of human brains are collected using techniques such as 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 
and electroencephalography (EEG). Technical advances and large-scale data sets 
have allowed for the development of models capable of predicting individual 
differences in traits and behavior using brain connectivity measures derived 
from neuroimaging data. Here, we present connectome-based predictive modeling 
(CPM), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior 
relationships from connectivity data using cross-validation. This protocol 
includes the following steps: (i) feature selection, (ii) feature summarization, 
(iii) model building, and (iv) assessment of prediction significance. We also 
include suggestions for visualizing the most predictive features (i.e., brain 
connections). The final result should be a generalizable model that takes brain 
connectivity data as input and generates predictions of behavioral measures in 
novel subjects, accounting for a considerable amount of the variance in these 
measures. It has been demonstrated that the CPM protocol performs as well as or 
better than many of the existing approaches in brain-behavior prediction. As CPM 
focuses on linear modeling and a purely data-driven approach, neuroscientists 
with limited or no experience in machine learning or optimization will find it 
easy to implement these protocols. Depending on the volume of data to be 
processed, the protocol can take 10-100 min for model building, 1-48 h for 
permutation testing, and 10-20 min for visualization of results.

There is extensive evidence that functional organization of the human brain 
varies dynamically as the brain switches between task demands, or cognitive 
states. This functional organization also varies across subjects, even when 
engaged in similar tasks. To date, the functional network organization of the 
brain has been considered static. In this work, we use fMRI data obtained across 
multiple cognitive states (task-evoked and rest conditions) and across multiple 
subjects, to measure state- and subject-specific functional network parcellation 
(the assignment of nodes to networks). Our parcellation approach provides a 
measure of how node-to-network assignment (NNA) changes across states and across 
subjects. We demonstrate that the brain's functional networks are not spatially 
fixed, but that many nodes change their network membership as a function of 
cognitive state. Such reconfigurations are highly robust and reliable to the 
extent that they can be used to predict cognitive state with up to 97% accuracy. 
Our findings suggest that if functional networks are to be defined via 
functional clustering of nodes, then it is essential to consider that such 
definitions may be fluid and cognitive-state dependent.

Achieving a comprehensive understanding of brain function requires multiple 
imaging modalities with complementary strengths. We present an approach for 
concurrent widefield optical and functional magnetic resonance imaging. By 
merging these modalities, we can simultaneously acquire whole-brain 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and whole-cortex calcium-sensitive 
fluorescent measures of brain activity. In a transgenic murine model, we show 
that calcium predicts the BOLD signal, using a model that optimizes a 
gamma-variant transfer function. We find consistent predictions across the 
cortex, which are best at low frequency (0.009-0.08 Hz). Furthermore, we show 
that the relationship between modality connectivity strengths varies by region. 
Our approach links cell-type-specific optical measurements of activity to the 
most widely used method for assessing human brain function.

Although the feeling of stress is ubiquitous, the neural mechanisms underlying 
this affective experience remain unclear. Here, we investigate functional 
hippocampal connectivity throughout the brain during an acute stressor and use 
machine learning to demonstrate that these networks can specifically predict the 
subjective feeling of stress. During a stressor, hippocampal connectivity with a 
network including the hypothalamus (known to regulate physiological stress) 
predicts feeling more stressed, whereas connectivity with regions such as 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with emotion regulation) predicts 
less stress. These networks do not predict a subjective state unrelated to 
stress, and a nonhippocampal network does not predict subjective stress. 
Hippocampal networks are consistent, specific to the construct of subjective 
stress, and broadly informative across measures of subjective stress. This 
approach provides opportunities for relating hypothesis-driven functional 
connectivity networks to clinically meaningful subjective states. Together, 
these results identify hippocampal networks that modulate the feeling of stress.

The brain plays a central role in the pathophysiology of overweight and obesity. 
Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM) is a newly developed, data-driven 
approach that exploits whole-brain functional connectivity to predict a behavior 
or trait that varies across individuals. We used CPM to determine whether brain 
"fingerprints" evoked during milkshake consumption could be isolated for common 
measures of adiposity in 67 adults with overweight and obesity. We found that 
CPM captures more variance in waist circumference than either percent body fat 
or BMI, the most frequently used measures to assess brain correlates of obesity. 
In a post-hoc analysis, we were also able to derive a largely separable 
functional connectivity network predicting fasting blood insulin. These findings 
suggest that, in individuals with overweight and obesity, brain network patterns 
may be more tightly coupled to waist circumference than BMI or percent body fat 
and that adiposity and glucose tolerance are associated with distinct maps, 
pointing to dissociable central pathophysiological phenotypes for obesity and 
diabetes.

Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback is a 
non-invasive, non-pharmacological therapeutic tool that may be useful for 
training behavior and alleviating clinical symptoms. Although previous work has 
used rt-fMRI to target brain activity in or functional connectivity between a 
small number of brain regions, there is growing evidence that symptoms and 
behavior emerge from interactions between a number of distinct brain areas. 
Here, we propose a new method for rt-fMRI, connectome-based neurofeedback, in 
which intermittent feedback is based on the strength of complex functional 
networks spanning hundreds of regions and thousands of functional connections. 
We first demonstrate the technical feasibility of calculating whole-brain 
functional connectivity in real-time and provide resources for implementing 
connectome-based neurofeedback. We next show that this approach can be used to 
provide accurate feedback about the strength of a previously defined 
connectome-based model of sustained attention, the saCPM, during task 
performance. Although, in our initial pilot sample, neurofeedback based on saCPM 
strength did not improve performance on out-of-scanner attention tasks, future 
work characterizing effects of network target, training duration, and amount of 
feedback on the efficacy of rt-fMRI can inform experimental or clinical trial 
designs.

Human neurodevelopment requires the organization of neural elements into complex 
structural and functional networks called the connectome. Emerging data suggest 
that prenatal exposure to maternal stress plays a role in the wiring, or 
miswiring, of the developing connectome. Stress-related symptoms are common in 
women during pregnancy and are risk factors for neurobehavioral disorders 
ranging from autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
and addiction, to major depression and schizophrenia. This review focuses on 
structural and functional connectivity imaging to assess the impact of changes 
in women's stress-based physiology on the dynamic development of the human 
connectome in the fetal brain.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging has proved to be a powerful tool to 
characterize spatiotemporal patterns of human brain activity. Analysis methods 
broadly fall into two camps: those summarizing properties of a region and those 
measuring interactions among regions. Here we pose an unappreciated question in 
the field: What are the strengths and limitations of each approach to study 
fundamental neural processes? We explore the relative utility of region- and 
connection-based measures in the context of three topics of interest: 
neurobiological relevance, brain-behavior relationships, and individual 
differences in brain organization. In each section, we offer illustrative 
examples. We hope that this discussion offers a novel and useful framework to 
support efforts to better understand the macroscale functional organization of 
the brain and how it relates to behavior.

Functional connectivity (FC) calculated from task fMRI data better reveals 
brain-phenotype relationships than rest-based FC, but how tasks have this effect 
is unknown. In over 700 individuals performing seven tasks, we use 
psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and predictive modeling analyses to 
demonstrate that task-induced changes in FC successfully predict phenotype, and 
these changes are not simply driven by task activation. Activation, however, is 
useful for prediction only if the in-scanner task is related to the predicted 
phenotype. To further characterize these predictive FC changes, we develop and 
apply an inter-subject PPI analysis. We find that moderate, but not high, 
task-induced consistency of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal 
across individuals is useful for prediction. Together, these findings 
demonstrate that in-scanner tasks have distributed, phenotypically relevant 
effects on brain functional organization, and they offer a framework to leverage 
both task activation and FC to reveal the neural bases of complex human traits, 
symptoms, and behaviors.

The prevalence of risky behavior such as substance use increases during 
adolescence; however, the neurobiological precursors to adolescent substance use 
remain unclear. Predictive modeling may complement previous work observing 
associations with known risk factors or substance use outcomes by developing 
generalizable models that predict early susceptibility. The aims of the current 
study were to identify and characterize behavioral and brain models of 
vulnerability to future substance use. Principal components analysis (PCA) of 
behavioral risk factors were used together with connectome-based predictive 
modeling (CPM) during rest and task-based functional imaging to generate 
predictive models in a large cohort of nine- and ten-year-olds enrolled in the 
Adolescent Brain & Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (NDA release 2.0.1). 
Dimensionality reduction (n = 9,437) of behavioral measures associated with 
substance use identified two latent dimensions that explained the largest amount 
of variance: risk-seeking (PC1; e.g., curiosity to try substances) and familial 
factors (PC2; e.g., family history of substance use disorder). Using 
cross-validated regularized regression in a subset of data (Year 1 Fast Track 
data; n>1,500), functional connectivity during rest and task conditions 
(resting-state; monetary incentive delay task; stop signal task; emotional 
n-back task) significantly predicted individual differences in risk-seeking 
(PC1) in held-out participants (partial correlations between predicted and 
observed scores controlling for motion and number of frames [rp]: 0.07-0.21). By 
contrast, functional connectivity was a weak predictor of familial risk factors 
associated with substance use (PC2) (rp: 0.03-0.06). These results demonstrate a 
novel approach to understanding substance use vulnerability, which-together with 
mechanistic perspectives-may inform strategies aimed at early identification of 
risk for addiction.

One of the most specific but also challenging properties of the brain is its 
topographic organization into distinct modules or cortical areas. In this paper, 
we first review the concept of topographic organization and its historical 
development. Next, we provide a critical discussion of the current definition of 
what constitutes a cortical area, why the concept has been so central to the 
field of neuroimaging and the challenges that arise from this view. A key aspect 
in this discussion is the issue of spatial scale and hierarchy in the brain. 
Focusing on in-vivo brain parcellation as a rapidly expanding field of research, 
we highlight potential limitations of the classical concept of cortical areas in 
the context of multi-modal parcellation and propose a revised interpretation of 
cortical areas building on the concept of neurobiological atoms that may be 
aggregated into larger units within and across modalities. We conclude by 
presenting an outlook on the implication of this revised concept for future 
mapping studies and raise some open questions in the context of brain 
parcellation.

Establishing brain-behavior associations that map brain organization to 
phenotypic measures and generalize to novel individuals remains a challenge in 
neuroimaging. Predictive modeling approaches that define and validate models 
with independent datasets offer a solution to this problem. While these methods 
can detect novel and generalizable brain-behavior associations, they can be 
daunting, which has limited their use by the wider connectivity community. Here, 
we offer practical advice and examples based on functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data for implementing these approaches. 
We hope these ten rules will increase the use of predictive models with 
neuroimaging data.

Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on the ability to map brain 
function using task-based fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential 
methods is still being characterized. A recent landmark study by Eklund and 
colleagues showed that popular multiple comparison corrections based on cluster 
extent suffer from unexpectedly low specificity (i.e., high false positive 
rate). Yet that study's focus on specificity, while important, is incomplete. 
The validity of a method depends also on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive 
rate or power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction remains poorly 
understood. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric 
cluster correction by resampling real data from five tasks in the Human 
Connectome Project and comparing results with those from the full "ground truth" 
datasets (n ​= ​480-493). Critically, we found that sensitivity after correction 
is lower than may be practical for many fMRI applications. In particular, 
sensitivity to medium-sized effects (|Cohen's d| ​= ​0.5) was less than 20% 
across tasks on average, about three times smaller than without any correction. 
Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a spatial bias in sensitivity 
that was independent of effect size. In comparison, correction based on the 
Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic approximately doubled 
sensitivity across tasks but increased spatial bias. These results suggest that 
we have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg in the 
activation-mapping literature due to our goal of limiting the familywise error 
rate through cluster extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our 
practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore conclude with a list of modern 
strategies to boost sensitivity while maintaining respectable specificity in 
future investigations.

The ability to sustain attention differs across people and changes within a 
single person over time. Although recent work has demonstrated that patterns of 
functional brain connectivity predict individual differences in sustained 
attention, whether these same patterns capture fluctuations in attention within 
individuals remains unclear. Here, across five independent studies, we 
demonstrate that the sustained attention connectome-based predictive model 
(CPM), a validated model of sustained attention function, generalizes to predict 
attentional state from data collected across minutes, days, weeks, and months. 
Furthermore, the sustained attention CPM is sensitive to within-subject state 
changes induced by propofol as well as sevoflurane, such that individuals show 
functional connectivity signatures of stronger attentional states when awake 
than when under deep sedation and light anesthesia. Together, these results 
demonstrate that fluctuations in attentional state reflect variability in the 
same functional connectivity patterns that predict individual differences in 
sustained attention.

CONTEXT: Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have alterations in 
brain activity that have been postulated to contribute to the adverse 
neurocognitive consequences of T1DM; however, the impact of T1DM and 
hypoglycemic unawareness on the brain's resting state activity remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individuals with T1DM and hypoglycemia 
unawareness (T1DM-Unaware) had changes in the brain resting state functional 
connectivity compared to healthy controls (HC) and those with T1DM and 
hypoglycemia awareness (T1DM-Aware).
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: 27 individuals with T1DM and 12 HC volunteers participated in the 
study.
INTERVENTION: All participants underwent blood oxygenation level dependent 
(BOLD) resting state functional magnetic brain imaging during a 2-step 
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic (90 mg/dL)-hypoglycemic (60 mg/dL) clamp.
OUTCOME: Changes in resting state functional connectivity.
RESULTS: Using 2 separate methods of functional connectivity analysis, we 
identified distinct differences in the resting state brain responses to mild 
hypoglycemia between HC, T1DM-Aware, and T1DM-Unaware participants, particularly 
in the angular gyrus, an integral component of the default mode network (DMN). 
Furthermore, changes in angular gyrus connectivity also correlated with greater 
symptoms of hypoglycemia (r = 0.461, P = 0.003) as well as higher scores of 
perceived stress (r = 0.531, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that individuals with T1DM have 
changes in the brain's resting state connectivity patterns, which may be further 
associated with differences in awareness to hypoglycemia. These changes in 
connectivity may be associated with alterations in functional outcomes among 
individuals with T1DM.

Chronic pain is a highly prevalent disease with poorly understood 
pathophysiology. In particular, the brain mechanisms mediating the transition 
from acute to chronic pain remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a 
subcortical signature of back pain. Specifically, subacute back pain patients 
who are at risk for developing chronic pain exhibit a smaller nucleus accumbens 
volume, which persists in the chronic phase, compared to healthy controls. The 
smaller accumbens volume was also observed in a separate cohort of chronic 
low-back pain patients and was associated with dynamic changes in functional 
connectivity. At baseline, subacute back pain patients showed altered local 
nucleus accumbens connectivity between putative shell and core, irrespective of 
the risk of transition to chronic pain. At follow-up, connectivity changes were 
observed between nucleus accumbens and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the 
patients with persistent pain. Analysis of the power spectral density of nucleus 
accumbens resting-state activity in the subacute and chronic back pain patients 
revealed loss of power in the slow-5 frequency band (0.01 to 0.027 Hz) which 
developed only in the chronic phase of pain. This loss of power was reproducible 
across two cohorts of chronic low-back pain patients obtained from different 
sites and accurately classified chronic low-back pain patients in two additional 
independent datasets. Our results provide evidence that lower nucleus accumbens 
volume confers risk for developing chronic pain and altered nucleus accumbens 
activity is a signature of the state of chronic pain.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate feasibility of developing a noninvasive extracellular pH 
(pHe ) mapping method on a clinical MRI scanner for molecular imaging of liver 
cancer.
METHODS: In vivo pHe mapping has been demonstrated on preclinical scanners 
(e.g., 9.4T, 11.7T) with Biosensor Imaging of Redundant Deviation in Shifts 
(BIRDS), where the pHe readout by 3D chemical shift imaging (CSI) depends on 
hyperfine shifts emanating from paramagnetic macrocyclic chelates like TmDOTP5- 
which upon extravasation from blood resides in the extracellular space. We 
implemented BIRDS-based pHe mapping on a clinical 3T Siemens scanner, where 
typically diamagnetic 1 H signals are detected using millisecond-long 
radiofrequency (RF) pulses, and 1 H shifts span over ±10 ppm with long 
transverse (T2 , 102 ms) and longitudinal (T1 , 103 ms) relaxation times. We 
modified this 3D-CSI method for ultra-fast acquisition with microsecond-long RF 
pulses, because even at 3T the paramagnetic 1 H shifts of TmDOTP5- have 
millisecond-long T2 and T1 and ultra-wide chemical shifts (±200 ppm) as 
previously observed in ultra-high magnetic fields.
RESULTS: We validated BIRDS-based pH in vitro with a pH electrode. We measured 
pHe in a rabbit model for liver cancer using VX2 tumors, which are highly 
vascularized and hyperglycolytic. Compared to intratumoral pHe (6.8 ± 0.1; P < 
10-9 ) and tumor's edge pHe (6.9 ± 0.1; P < 10-7 ), liver parenchyma pHe was 
significantly higher (7.2 ± 0.1). Tumor localization was confirmed with 
histopathological markers of necrosis (hematoxylin and eosin), glucose uptake 
(glucose transporter 1), and tissue acidosis (lysosome-associated membrane 
protein 2).
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates feasibility and potential clinical 
translatability of high-resolution pHe mapping to monitor tumor aggressiveness 
and therapeutic outcome, all to improve personalized cancer treatment planning.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness 
with more than 50% of patients not achieving an adequate response using 
first-line treatments. Reliable models that predict antidepressant treatment 
outcome are needed to guide clinical decision making. We aimed to build 
predictive models of treatment improvement for MDD patients using machine 
learning approaches based on fMRI resting-state functional connectivity 
patterns.
METHODS: Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 192 untreated MDD patients 
at recruitment, and their severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression (HAMD) at baseline. Patients were given medication after 
the initial MR scan and their symptoms were monitored through HAMD for a period 
of six months. Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) algorithms were 
implemented to predict the improvement in HAMD score at one month from 
resting-state connectivity at baseline. Additionally, by selectively combining 
the features from all leave-one-out iterations in the model building stage, we 
created a consensus model that could be generalized to predict improvement in 
HAMD score in samples of non-overlapping subjects at different time points.
RESULTS: Using baseline functional connectivity, CPM successfully predicted 
symptom improvement of depression at one month. In addition, a consensus 'MDD 
improvement model' could predict symptom improvement for novel individuals at 
the two-week, one-month, two-month and three-month time points after 
antidepressant treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual pre-treatment functional brain networks contain 
meaningful information that can be gleaned to build predictors of treatment 
outcome. The identified MDD improvement networks could be an appropriate 
biomarker for predicting individual therapeutic response of antidepressant 
treatment. Replication and validation using other large datasets will be a key 
next step before these models can be used in clinical practice.

Performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of children can be 
a difficult task, as participants tend to move while being scanned. Head motion 
represents a significant confound in fMRI connectivity analyses. One approach to 
limit motion has been to use shorter MRI protocols, though this reduces the 
reliability of results. Hence, there is a need to implement methods to achieve 
high-quality, low-motion data while not sacrificing data quantity. Here we show 
that by using a mock scan protocol prior to a scan, in conjunction with other 
in-scan steps (weighted blanket and incentive system), it is possible to achieve 
low-motion fMRI data in pediatric participants (age range: 7-17 years old) 
undergoing a 60 min MRI session. We also observe that motion is low during the 
MRI protocol in a separate replication group of participants, including some 
with autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, the results indicate it is possible 
to conduct long scan protocols in difficult-to-scan populations and still 
achieve high-quality data, thus potentially allowing more reliable fMRI 
findings.

Fast ROtary Nonlinear Spatial ACquisition (FRONSAC) was recently introduced as a 
new strategy that applies nonlinear gradients as a small perturbation to improve 
image quality in highly undersampled MRI. In addition to experimentally showing 
the previously simulated improvement to image quality, this work introduces the 
insight that Cartesian-FRONSAC retains many desirable features of Cartesian 
imaging. Cartesian-FRONSAC preserves the existing linear gradient waveforms of 
the Cartesian sequence while adding oscillating nonlinear gradient waveforms. 
Experiments show that performance is essentially identical to Cartesian imaging 
in terms of (1) resilience to experimental imperfections, like timing errors or 
off-resonance spins, (2) accommodating scan geometry changes without the need 
for recalibration or additional field mapping, (3) contrast generation, as in 
turbo spin echo. Despite these similarities to Cartesian imaging, which provides 
poor parallel imaging performance, Cartesian-FRONSAC consistently shows reduced 
undersampling artifacts and better response to advanced reconstruction 
techniques. A final experiment shows that hardware requirements are also 
flexible. Cartesian-FRONSAC improves accelerated imaging while retaining the 
robustness and flexibility critical to real clinical use.

While neuroimaging studies typically collapse data from many subjects, brain 
functional organization varies between individuals, and characterizing this 
variability is crucial for relating brain activity to behavioral phenotypes. 
Rest has become the default state for probing individual differences, chiefly 
because it is easy to acquire and a supposed neutral backdrop. However, the 
assumption that rest is the optimal condition for individual differences 
research is largely untested. In fact, other brain states may afford a better 
ratio of within- to between-subject variability, facilitating biomarker 
discovery. Depending on the trait or behavior under study, certain tasks may 
bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across subjects, essentially enhancing the 
individual signal in networks of interest beyond what can be measured at rest. 
Here, we review theoretical considerations and existing work on how brain state 
influences individual differences in functional connectivity, present some 
preliminary analyses of within- and between-subject variability across 
conditions using data from the Human Connectome Project, and outline questions 
for future study.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate further findings that 
corroborate similarities between corrected sagittal craniosynostosis and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim is to further 
characterize the neurocognitive deficits seen in adolescents with corrected 
craniosynostosis by comparing it to established learning deficits such as ADHD.
METHODS: A total of 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 10 
sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (sNSC), 10 ADHD-combined, and 10 control 
adolescents were studied. The fMRI scans were analyzed utilizing Statistical 
Parametric Mapping (University College London, UK) and analyzed with 
BioImageSuite (Yale University, New Haven, CT).
RESULTS: The ADHD has lower connectivity to Brodmann area (BA) 11 (Montreal 
Neurological Institution [MNI]: -12,26,-21), BA20 (MNI: 62,-24,-25), and BA21 
(MNI: 62,-32,-23) compared to sNSC and controls (P < 0.001). The sNSC has a 
unique visuospatial defect, compared to ADHD, created by decreased connectivity 
to BA31 (MNI: -3,-68,37), BA7 (MNI: -4,-68,41), BA19 (MNI: 0,-83,31), visual 
association cortex (MNI: -4,-78,22), and primary visual cortex (MNI: 7,-74,21) 
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients born with sNSC have different neural connections than 
children born with ADHD. Patients born with sNSC have decreased connections in 
areas of visual processing and increased connections in areas of attention and 
auditory processing than patients with ADHD. Therefore, children with sagittal 
craniosynsotosis may have learning difficulties that, similar, yet different 
from ADHD.

PURPOSE: Previous nonlinear gradient research has focused on trajectories that 
reconstruct images with a minimum number of echoes. Here we describe sequences 
where the nonlinear gradients vary in time to acquire the image in a single 
readout. The readout is designed to be very smooth so that it can be compressed 
to minimal time without violating peripheral nerve stimulation limits, yielding 
an image from a single 4 ms echo.
THEORY AND METHODS: This sequence was inspired by considering the code of each 
voxel, i.e. the phase accumulation that a voxel follows through the readout, an 
approach connected to traditional encoding theory. We present simulations for 
the initial sequence, a low slew rate analog, and higher resolution 
reconstructions.
RESULTS: Extremely fast acquisitions are achievable, though as one would expect, 
SNR is reduced relative to the slower Cartesian sampling schemes because of the 
high gradient strengths.
CONCLUSIONS: The prospect that nonlinear gradients can acquire images in a 
single <10 ms echo makes this a novel and interesting approach to image 
encoding.

Functional brain connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) is a popular technique for investigating neural organization in 
both healthy subjects and patients with mental illness. Despite a rapidly 
growing body of literature, however, functional connectivity research has yet to 
deliver biomarkers that can aid psychiatric diagnosis or prognosis at the 
single-subject level. One impediment to developing such practical tools has been 
uncertainty regarding the ratio of intra- to interindividual variability in 
functional connectivity; in other words, how much variance is state- versus 
trait-related. Here, we review recent evidence that functional connectivity 
profiles are both reliable within subjects and unique across subjects, and that 
features of these profiles relate to behavioral phenotypes. Together, these 
results suggest the potential to discover reliable correlates of present and 
future illness and/or response to treatment in the strength of an individual's 
functional brain connections. Ultimately, this work could help develop 
personalized approaches to psychiatric illness.

relacionadas con los fenotipos conductuales. En conjunto estos resultados 
sugieren la posibilidad de descubrir correlatos confiables de la enfermedad y/o

Memory deficits are observed in a range of psychiatric disorders, but it is 
unclear whether memory deficits arise from a shared brain correlate across 
disorders or from various dysfunctions unique to each disorder. Connectome-based 
predictive modeling is a computational method that captures individual 
differences in functional connectomes associated with behavioral phenotypes such 
as memory. We used publicly available task-based functional MRI data from 
patients with schizophrenia (n = 33), bipolar disorder (n = 34), attention 
deficit hyper-activity disorder (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 73) to model 
the macroscale brain networks associated with working, short- and long-term 
memory. First, we use 10-fold and leave-group-out analyses to demonstrate that 
the same macroscale brain networks subserve memory across diagnostic groups and 
that individual differences in memory performance are related to individual 
differences within networks distributed throughout the brain, including the 
subcortex, default mode network, limbic network, and cerebellum. Next, we show 
that diagnostic groups are associated with significant differences in 
whole-brain functional connectivity that are distinct from the predictive models 
of memory. Finally, we show that models trained on the transdiagnostic sample 
generalize to novel, healthy participants (n = 515) from the Human Connectome 
Project. These results suggest that despite significant differences in 
whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity between diagnostic groups, the 
core macroscale brain networks that subserve memory are shared.

Individual differences in working memory relate to performance differences in 
general cognitive ability. The neural bases of such individual differences, 
however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a data-driven technique known as 
connectome-based predictive modeling, we built models to predict individual 
working memory performance from whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. 
Using n-back or rest data from the Human Connectome Project, connectome-based 
predictive models significantly predicted novel individuals' 2-back accuracy. 
Model predictions also correlated with measures of fluid intelligence and, with 
less strength, sustained attention. Separate fluid intelligence models predicted 
working memory score, as did sustained attention models, again with less 
strength. Anatomical feature analysis revealed significant overlap between 
working memory and fluid intelligence models, particularly in utilization of 
prefrontal and parietal regions, and less overlap in predictive features between 
working memory and sustained attention models. Furthermore, showing the 
generality of these models, the working memory model developed from Human 
Connectome Project data generalized to predict memory in an independent data set 
of 157 older adults (mean age = 69 years; 48 healthy, 54 amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment, 55 Alzheimer disease). The present results demonstrate that 
distributed functional connectivity patterns predict individual variation in 
working memory capability across the adult life span, correlating with 
constructs including fluid intelligence and sustained attention.

Global brain connectivity (GBC) identifies regions of the brain, termed "hubs," 
which are densely connected and metabolically costly, and have a wide influence 
on brain function. Since obesity is associated with central and peripheral 
metabolic dysfunction we sought to determine if GBC is altered in obesity. Two 
independent fMRI data sets were subjected to GBC analyses. The first data set 
was acquired while participants (n = 15 healthy weight and 15 obese) tasted 
milkshake and the second with participants at rest (n = 33 healthy weight and 28 
obese). In the resting state and during milkshake consumption GBC is 
consistently decreased in the ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, 
insula and caudate nucleus, and increased in brain regions belonging to the 
dorsal attention network including premotor areas, superior parietal lobule, and 
visual cortex. During milkshake consumption, but not at rest, additional 
decreases in GBC are observed in feeding-related circuitry including the insula, 
amygdala, anterior hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem and 
somatomotor cortex. Additionally, GBC differences were not accounted for by age. 
These results demonstrate that obesity is associated with decreased GBC in 
prefrontal and feeding circuits and increased GBC in the dorsal attention 
network. We therefore conclude that global brain organization is altered in 
obesity to favor networks important for external orientation over those 
monitoring homeostatic state and guiding feeding decisions. Furthermore, since 
prefrontal decreases are also observed at rest in obese individuals future work 
should evaluate whether these changes are associated with neurocognitive 
impairments frequently observed in obesity and diabetes. Hum Brain Mapp

The goal of human brain mapping has long been to delineate the functional 
subunits in the brain and elucidate the functional role of each of these brain 
regions. Recent work has focused on whole-brain parcellation of functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to identify these subunits and create a 
functional atlas. Functional connectivity approaches to understand the brain at 
the network level require such an atlas to assess connections between parcels 
and extract network properties. While no single functional atlas has emerged as 
the dominant atlas to date, there remains an underlying assumption that such an 
atlas exists. Using fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two 
independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional parcellations 
based on fMRI connectivity data reconfigure substantially and in a meaningful 
manner, according to brain state.

Although fluctuations in sustained attention are ubiquitous, most psychological 
experiments treat them as noise, averaging performance over many trials. The 
current study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode whether, on 
each trial of a cognitive task, participants are in an optimal or suboptimal 
attentional state. During fMRI, participants performed n-back tasks, composed of 
central face images overlaid on distractor scenes, with low, perceptual, and 
working memory load. Instructions were to respond to novel faces and withhold 
response to rare repeats. To index attentional state, reaction time variability 
was calculated at each correct response. Participants' 50% least variable trials 
were labeled optimal, or "in the zone," and their 50% most erratic trials were 
labeled suboptimal, or "out of the zone." Support vector machine classifiers 
trained on activity in the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network 
(DAN), and task-relevant fusiform face area (FFA) distinguished in-the-zone and 
out-of-the-zone trials in all tasks. Consistent with evidence that distractors 
are processed when central task load is low, parahippocampal place area (PPA) 
classifiers were only successful in the low load task. Classification in 
anatomical regions across the brain revealed widespread coding of attentional 
state. In contrast to these robust pattern analyses, univariate signal in DMN, 
DAN, FFA, and PPA did not distinguish states, suggesting a nuanced relationship 
to sustained attention. In sum, MVPA can be used to decode trial-by-trial 
attentional state throughout much of cortex, helping to characterize how 
attention network fluctuations correlate with performance variability.

Large datasets that enable researchers to perform investigations with 
unprecedented rigor are growing increasingly common in neuroimaging. Due to the 
simultaneous increasing popularity of open science, these state-of-the-art 
datasets are more accessible than ever to researchers around the world. While 
analysis of these samples has pushed the field forward, they pose a new set of 
challenges that might cause difficulties for novice users. Here we offer 
practical tips for working with large datasets from the end-user's perspective. 
We cover all aspects of the data lifecycle: from what to consider when 
downloading and storing the data to tips on how to become acquainted with a 
dataset one did not collect and what to share when communicating results. This 
manuscript serves as a practical guide one can use when working with large 
neuroimaging datasets, thus dissolving barriers to scientific discovery.

Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of multisite MRI functional 
connectivity (fcMRI) studies. While multisite studies provide an efficient way 
to accelerate data collection and increase sample sizes, especially for rare 
clinical populations, any effects of site or MRI scanner could ultimately limit 
power and weaken results. Little data exists on the stability of functional 
connectivity measurements across sites and sessions. In this study, we assess 
the influence of site and session on resting state functional connectivity 
measurements in a healthy cohort of traveling subjects (8 subjects scanned twice 
at each of 8 sites) scanned as part of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal 
Study (NAPLS). Reliability was investigated in three types of connectivity 
analyses: (1) seed-based connectivity with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), 
right motor cortex (RMC), and left thalamus (LT) as seeds; (2) the intrinsic 
connectivity distribution (ICD), a voxel-wise connectivity measure; and (3) 
matrix connectivity, a whole-brain, atlas-based approach to assessing 
connectivity between nodes. Contributions to variability in connectivity due to 
subject, site, and day-of-scan were quantified and used to assess 
between-session (test-retest) reliability in accordance with Generalizability 
Theory. Overall, no major site, scanner manufacturer, or day-of-scan effects 
were found for the univariate connectivity analyses; instead, subject effects 
dominated relative to the other measured factors. However, summaries of 
voxel-wise connectivity were found to be sensitive to site and scanner 
manufacturer effects. For all connectivity measures, although subject variance 
was three times the site variance, the residual represented 60-80% of the 
variance, indicating that connectivity differed greatly from scan to scan 
independent of any of the measured factors (i.e., subject, site, and 
day-of-scan). Thus, for a single 5min scan, reliability across connectivity 
measures was poor (ICC=0.07-0.17), but increased with increasing scan duration 
(ICC=0.21-0.36 at 25min). The limited effects of site and scanner manufacturer 
support the use of multisite studies, such as NAPLS, as a viable means of 
collecting data on rare populations and increasing power in univariate 
functional connectivity studies. However, the results indicate that aggregation 
of fcMRI data across longer scan durations is necessary to increase the 
reliability of connectivity estimates at the single-subject level.

Resting-state and task-based functional connectivity matrices, or connectomes, 
are powerful predictors of individual differences in phenotypic measures. 
However, most of the current state-of-the-art algorithms only build predictive 
models based on a single connectome for each individual. This approach neglects 
the complementary information contained in connectomes from different sources 
and reduces prediction performance. In order to combine different task 
connectomes into a single predictive model in a principled way, we propose a 
novel prediction framework, termed multidimensional connectome-based predictive 
modeling. Two specific algorithms are developed and implemented under this 
framework. Using two large open-source datasets with multiple tasks-the Human 
Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we validate 
and compare our framework against performing connectome-based predictive 
modeling (CPM) on each task connectome independently, CPM on a general 
functional connectivity matrix created by averaging together all task 
connectomes for an individual, and CPM with a naïve extension to multiple 
connectomes where each edge for each task is selected independently. Our 
framework exhibits superior performance in prediction compared with the other 
competing methods. We found that different tasks contribute differentially to 
the final predictive model, suggesting that the battery of tasks used in 
prediction is an important consideration. This work makes two major 
contributions: First, two methods for combining multiple connectomes from 
different task conditions in one predictive model are demonstrated; Second, we 
show that these models outperform a previously validated single connectome-based 
predictive model approach.

Recent work with functional connectivity data has led to significant progress in 
understanding the functional organization of the brain. While the majority of 
the literature has focused on group-level parcellation approaches, there is 
ample evidence that the brain varies in both structure and function across 
individuals. In this work, we introduce a parcellation technique that 
incorporates delineation of functional networks both at the individual- and 
group-level. The proposed technique deploys the notion of "submodularity" to 
jointly parcellate the cerebral cortex while establishing an inclusive 
correspondence between the individualized functional networks. Using this 
parcellation technique, we successfully established a cross-validated predictive 
model that predicts individuals' sex, solely based on the parcellation schemes 
(i.e. the node-to-network assignment vectors). The sex prediction finding 
illustrates that individualized parcellation of functional networks can reveal 
subgroups in a population and suggests that the use of a global network 
parcellation may overlook fundamental differences in network organization. This 
is a particularly important point to consider in studies comparing patients 
versus controls or even patient subgroups. Network organization may differ 
between individuals and global configurations should not be assumed. This 
approach to the individualized study of functional organization in the brain has 
many implications for both neuroscience and clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis and intervention 
assessment in neurological disease. Its full potential has not been realized due 
in part to challenges in harmonizing advanced techniques across multiple sites.
PURPOSE: To develop a method for the assessment of reliability and repeatability 
of advanced multisite-multisession neuroimaging studies and specifically to 
assess the reliability of an advanced MRI protocol, including multiband fMRI and 
diffusion tensor MRI, in a multisite setting.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
POPULATION: Twice repeated measurement of a single subject with stable 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) at seven institutions.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3 T MRI protocol included higher spatial resolution 
anatomical scans, a variable flip-angle longitudinal relaxation rate constant 
(R1 ≡ 1/T1 ) measurement, quantitative magnetization transfer imaging, diffusion 
tensor imaging, and a resting-state fMRI (rsFMRI) series.
ASSESSMENT: Multiple methods of assessing intrasite repeatability and intersite 
reliability were evaluated for imaging metrics derived from each sequence.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Student's t-test, Pearson's r, and intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) (2,1) were employed to assess repeatability and reliability. 
Two new statistical metrics are introduced that frame reliability and 
repeatability in the respective units of the measurements themselves.
RESULTS: Intrasite repeatability was excellent for quantitative R1 , 
magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) based 
metrics (r > 0.95). rsFMRI metrics were less repeatable (r = 0.8). Intersite 
reliability was excellent for R1 , MTR, and DWI (ICC >0.9), and moderate for 
rsFMRI metrics (ICC∼0.4).
DATA CONCLUSION: From most reliable to least, using a new reliability metric 
introduced here, MTR > R1 > DWI > rsFMRI; for repeatability, MTR > DWI > R1 > 
rsFMRI. A graphical method for at-a-glance assessment of reliability and 
repeatability, effect sizes, and outlier identification in 
multisite-multisession neuroimaging studies is introduced.

The T-cell response defines the pathogenesis of many common chronic disease 
states, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection. 
Therefore, a diagnostic strategy that visualizes this response can potentially 
lead to early therapeutic intervention, avoiding catastrophic organ failure or 
prolonged sickness. In addition, the means to deliver a drug dose to those cells 
in situ with the same specificity used to image those cells would provide for a 
powerful therapeutic alternative for many disease states involving T cells. In 
this report, we review emerging nanosystems that can be used for simultaneous 
tracking and drug delivery to those cells. Because of their versatility, these 
systems--which combine specific receptor targeting with an imaging agent and 
drug delivery--are suited to both basic science and applications, from 
developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and alloimmune diseases, to 
noninvasive tracking of pathogenic T-cell migration.

Sophisticated neuroimaging strategies demonstrate alterations in functional 
connectivity at school age, adolescence, and young adulthood in individuals born 
preterm. Recent data suggest these alterations are present in the postnatal 
period prior to term-equivalent age in neonates born preterm. Likewise, 
functional organization increases across development, but the influence of 
preterm birth on this fundamental infrastructure is immediate and unchanging. 
This article briefly reviews the current methods of measuring functional 
connectivity throughout development in those born preterm, and the association 
of functional connectivity with language disorders. Taken together, these data 
suggest that the effects of preterm birth on the functional organization of 
language in the developing brain are both proximate and long-lasting.

Functional MRI (fMRI) might provide important insights into emerging data that 
suggest that recovery from injury can occur in the brains of children born 
prematurely. Strategies employing auditory stimulation demonstrate 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activation in preterm infants as young as 33 
weeks' gestational age, and reliable BOLD signal in response to visual 
stimulation occurs at term-equivalent age. Strategies based on fMRI are 
particularly suited to the study of language and memory, and emerging data are 
likely to provide insights into perplexing reports that have demonstrated 
improving cognitive scores but persistent volumetric and microstructural changes 
in frontotemporal language systems in the prematurely born. Even when sex, 
gestational age and early medical and environmental interventions are taken into 
account, fMRI data from several investigators suggest the engagement of 
alternative neural networks for language and memory in the developing preterm 
brain.

Wilson disease (WD) can manifest with hepatic or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our 
understanding of the in vivo brain changes in WD, particularly in the hepatic 
phenotype, is limited. Thirty subjects with WD and 30 age- and gender-matched 
controls participated. WD group underwent neuropsychiatric assessment. Unified 
WD Rating Scale neurological exam scores were used to determine neurological 
(WDN, score > 0) and hepatic-only (WDH, score 0) subgroups. All subjects 
underwent 3 Tesla anatomical and resting-state functional MRI. Diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) were performed only in 
the WD group. Volumetric, DTI, and functional connectivity analyses were 
performed to determine between-group differences. WDN and WDH groups were 
matched in demographic and psychiatric profiles. The entire WD group compared to 
controls showed significant thinning in the bilateral superior frontal cortex. 
The WDN group compared to control and WDH groups showed prominent structural 
brain changes including significant striatal and thalamic atrophy, more 
subcortical hypointense lesions on SWI, and diminished white matter integrity in 
the bilateral anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum. However, the WDH 
group also showed significant white matter volume loss compared to controls. The 
functional connectivity between the frontostriatal nodes was significantly 
reduced in the WDN group, whereas that of the hippocampus was significantly 
increased in the WDH group compared to controls. In summary, structural and 
functional brain changes were present even in neurologically non-manifesting WD 
patients in this cross-sectional study. Longitudinal brain MRI scans may be 
useful as biomarkers for prognostication and optimization of treatment 
strategies in WD.

Over the past few years, MRI has become an indispensable tool for diagnosing 
multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the current MRI criteria for MS diagnosis have 
imperfect sensitivity and specificity. The central vein sign (CVS) has recently 
been proposed as a novel MRI biomarker to improve the accuracy and speed of MS 
diagnosis. Evidence indicates that the presence of the CVS in individual lesions 
can accurately differentiate MS from other diseases that mimic this condition. 
However, the predictive value of the CVS for the development of clinical MS in 
patients with suspected demyelinating disease is still unknown. Moreover, the 
lack of standardization for the definition and imaging of the CVS currently 
limits its clinical implementation and validation. On the basis of a thorough 
review of the existing literature on the CVS and the consensus opinion of the 
members of the North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative, 
this article provides statements and recommendations aimed at helping 
radiologists and neurologists to better understand, refine, standardize and 
evaluate the CVS in the diagnosis of MS.

Functional connectomes computed from fMRI provide a means to characterize 
individual differences in the patterns of BOLD synchronization across regions of 
the entire brain. Using four resting-state fMRI datasets with a wide range of 
ages, we show that individual differences of the functional connectome are 
stable across 3 months to 1-2 years (and even detectable at above-chance levels 
across 3 years). Medial frontal and frontoparietal networks appear to be both 
unique and stable, resulting in high ID rates, as did a combination of these two 
networks. We conduct analyses demonstrating that these results are not driven by 
head motion. We also show that edges contributing the most to a successful ID 
tend to connect nodes in the frontal and parietal cortices, while edges 
contributing the least tend to connect cross-hemispheric homologs. Our results 
demonstrate that the functional connectome is stable across years and that high 
ID rates are not an idiosyncratic aspect of a specific dataset, but rather 
reflect stable individual differences in the functional connectivity of the 
brain.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to understand the neurological 
differences between patients born with combined sagittal and metopic 
craniosynostosis (SMc) and isolated sagittal craniosynostosis (ISc) by studying 
aberrations in functional brain connectivity and white matter microstructure, 
before surgery, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
METHODS: The authors collected DTI and resting-state (ie, no sedation and 
asleep) functional connectivity MRI data in 10 infant patients preoperatively: 5 
in the SMc group (4.3 ± 1 months) and 5 in the ISc group (4.8 ± 1.1 months). 
Resting state fMRI imaging and DTI data were acquired using a 3-T Siemens Trio 
MRI system (Erlangen, Germany) while the infant patients slept. fMRI data were 
corrected for movement using SPM, underwent cerebrospinal fluid and white matter 
signal regression and further analyzed with BioImageSuite. For the DTI data, 3 
diffusion runs were averaged, processed utilizing FMRIB Software Library, and 
analyzed statistically using BioImageSuite.
RESULTS: Comparing the SMc versus ISc groups, SMc demonstrated that there was 
increased connectivity, statistically significant differences, in neural 
networks between children with sagittal synostosis alone versus those with 
sagittal with metopic synostosis, in the right BA 31 and BA 23 (corresponding to 
the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (P < 0.001). Analysis of the DTI revealed 
increased fractional anisotropy (normal maturation of white tracts) in the SMc 
group in the cingulum compared to the ISc group (P < 0.05). Differences in the 
functional networks include increased connectivity right frontoparietal network 
(RFPN) in ISc and increased connectivity in the primary visual network (V1) in 
SMc (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The SMc had increased connectivity as measured by fMR in the PCC, an 
area associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The DTI analysis 
demonstrated an increase in fractional anisotropy of the cingulum in the SMc 
group, a white matter tract projecting from the cingulate cortex; connections of 
the limbic (emotional regulation) system are instrumental. In SMc, increase of 
connectivity in the PCC correlates with an increase in maturation of the 
cingulum compared to ISc. There is increased connectivity of the RFPN network in 
the ISc and increased connectivity of the V1 network in the SMc patients. The 
SMc group has increased connectivity in the PCC, the original seed of the DMN 
network, and decreased connectivity to the RFPN network. The pattern of 
increased connectivity in the area of the DMN and decreased connectivity in the 
RFPN network is similar to the trend when comparing ADHD patients to normal 
controls. SMc has more similar functional network connectivity to ADHD as 
compared to ISc.

Preterm (PT) birth results in long-term alterations in functional and structural 
connectivity, but the related changes in anatomical covariance are just 
beginning to be explored. To test the hypothesis that PT birth alters patterns 
of anatomical covariance, we investigated brain volumes of 25 PTs and 22 terms 
at young adulthood using magnetic resonance imaging. Using regional volumetrics, 
seed-based analyses, and whole brain graphs, we show that PT birth is associated 
with reduced volume in bilateral temporal and inferior frontal lobes, left 
caudate, left fusiform, and posterior cingulate for prematurely born subjects at 
young adulthood. Seed-based analyses demonstrate altered patterns of anatomical 
covariance for PTs compared with terms. PTs exhibit reduced covariance with R 
Brodmann area (BA) 47, Broca's area, and L BA 21, Wernicke's area, and white 
matter volume in the left prefrontal lobe, but increased covariance with R BA 47 
and left cerebellum. Graph theory analyses demonstrate that measures of network 
complexity are significantly less robust in PTs compared with term controls. 
Volumes in regions showing group differences are significantly correlated with 
phonological awareness, the fundamental basis for reading acquisition, for the 
PTs. These data suggest both long-lasting and clinically significant alterations 
in the covariance in the PTs at young adulthood.

Recent work has begun to relate individual differences in brain functional 
organization to human behaviors and cognition, but the best brain state to 
reveal such relationships remains an open question. In two large, independent 
data sets, we here show that cognitive tasks amplify trait-relevant individual 
differences in patterns of functional connectivity, such that predictive models 
built from task fMRI data outperform models built from resting-state fMRI data. 
Further, certain tasks consistently yield better predictions of fluid 
intelligence than others, and the task that generates the best-performing models 
varies by sex. By considering task-induced brain state and sex, the 
best-performing model explains over 20% of the variance in fluid intelligence 
scores, as compared to <6% of variance explained by rest-based models. This 
suggests that identifying and inducing the right brain state in a given group 
can better reveal brain-behavior relationships, motivating a paradigm shift from 
rest- to task-based functional connectivity analyses.

INTRODUCTION: Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) is a recently developed 
machine-learning-based framework to predict individual differences in behavior 
from functional brain connectivity (FC). In these models, FC was operationalized 
as Pearson's correlation between brain regions' fMRI time courses. However, 
Pearson's correlation is limited since it only captures linear relationships. We 
developed a more generalized metric of FC based on information flow. This 
measure represents FC by abstracting the brain as a flow network of nodes that 
send bits of information to each other, where bits are quantified through an 
information theory statistic called transfer entropy.
METHODS: With a sample of individuals performing a sustained attention task and 
resting during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 25), we use the 
CPM framework to build machine-learning models that predict attention from FC 
patterns measured with information flow. Models trained on n - 1 participants' 
task-based patterns were applied to an unseen individual's resting-state pattern 
to predict task performance. For further validation, we applied our model to two 
independent datasets that included resting-state fMRI data and a measure of 
attention (Attention Network Task performance [n = 41] and stop-signal task 
performance [n = 72]).
RESULTS: Our model significantly predicted individual differences in attention 
task performance across three different datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Information flow may be a useful complement to Pearson's 
correlation as a measure of FC because of its advantages for nonlinear analysis 
and network structure characterization.

Schizophrenia is a severe global health problem, with over half of such patients 
experiencing auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). A better understanding of 
the neural correlates differentiating patients experiencing AVHs from patients 
not experiencing AVHs and healthy controls may identify targets that lead to 
better treatment strategies for AVHs. Employing 2 data-driven, voxel-based 
measure of functional connectivity, we studied 46 patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder (28 experiencing AVHs and 18 not experiencing AVHs). 
Twenty healthy controls matched for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, 
handedness, and estimated verbal intelligence were included for comparison. The 
intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD) was used to model each voxel's 
connectivity to the rest of the brain using a Weibull distribution. To 
investigate lateralization of connectivity, we used cross-hemisphere ICD, a 
method that separates the contribution of each hemisphere to interrogate 
connectivity laterality. Patients with AVHs compared with patients without AVHs 
exhibited significantly decreased whole-brain connectivity in the medial 
prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, less lateralized connectivity 
in left putamen, and more lateralized connectivity in left interior frontal 
gyrus. Correlations with Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) and post hoc 
seed connectivity analyses revealed significantly altered network connectivity. 
Using the results from all analyses comparing the patient groups and 
correlations with AHRS, we identified a potential AVH network, consisting of 25 
nodes, showing substantial overlap with the default mode network and language 
processing networks. This network as a whole, instead of individual nodes, may 
represent actionable targets for interventions.

The effect of life stress on depression is moderated by a repeat length 
variation in the transcriptional control region of the serotonin transporter 
gene, which renders carriers of the short variant vulnerable for depression. We 
investigated the underlying neural mechanisms of these epigenetic processes in 
individuals with no history of psychopathology by using multimodal magnetic 
resonance-based imaging (functional, perfusion, and structural), genotyping, and 
self-reported life stress and rumination. Based on functional MRI and perfusion 
data, we found support for a model by which life stress interacts with the 
effect of serotonin transporter genotype on amygdala and hippocampal resting 
activation, two regions involved in depression and stress. Life stress also 
differentially affected, as a function of serotonin transporter genotype, 
functional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus with a wide network of 
other regions, as well as gray matter structural features, and affected 
individuals' level of rumination. These interactions may constitute a neural 
mechanism for epigenetic vulnerability toward, or protection against, 
depression.

BACKGROUND: Once considered mere noise, fMRI-based functional connectivity has 
become a major neuroscience tool in part due to early studies demonstrating its 
reliability. These fundamental studies revealed only the tip of the iceberg; 
over the past decade, many test-retest reliability studies have continued to add 
nuance to our understanding of this complex topic. A summary of these diverse 
and at times contradictory perspectives is needed.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to summarize the existing knowledge regarding test-retest 
reliability of functional connectivity at the most basic unit of analysis: the 
individual edge level. This entailed (1) a meta-analytic estimate of reliability 
and (2) a review of factors influencing reliability.
METHODS: A search of Scopus was conducted to identify studies that estimated 
edge-level test-retest reliability. To facilitate comparisons across studies, 
eligibility was restricted to studies measuring reliability via the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC). The meta-analysis included a random effects 
pooled estimate of mean edge-level ICC, with studies nested within datasets. The 
review included a narrative summary of factors influencing edge-level ICC.
RESULTS: From an initial pool of 212 studies, 44 studies were identified for the 
qualitative review and 25 studies for quantitative meta-analysis. On average, 
individual edges exhibited a "poor" ICC of 0.29 (95% CI = 0.23 to 0.36). The 
most reliable measurements tended to involve: (1) stronger, within-network, 
cortical edges, (2) eyes open, awake, and active recordings, (3) more 
within-subject data, (4) shorter test-retest intervals, (5) no artifact 
correction (likely due in part to reliable artifact), and (6) full 
correlation-based connectivity with shrinkage.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first meta-analysis and systematic review 
investigating test-retest reliability of edge-level functional connectivity. Key 
findings suggest there is room for improvement, but care should be taken to 
avoid promoting reliability at the expense of validity. By pooling existing 
knowledge regarding this key facet of accuracy, this study supports broader 
efforts to improve inferences in the field.

Language mapping is a key goal in neurosurgical planning. fMRI mapping typically 
proceeds with a focus on Broca's and Wernicke's areas, although multiple other 
language-critical areas are now well-known. We evaluated whether clinicians 
could use a novel approach, including clinician-driven individualized 
thresholding, to reliably identify six language regions, including Broca's Area, 
Wernicke's Area (inferior, superior), Exner's Area, Supplementary Speech Area, 
Angular Gyrus, and Basal Temporal Language Area. We studied 22 epilepsy and 
tumor patients who received Wada and fMRI (age 36.4[12.5]; Wada language 
left/right/mixed in 18/3/1). fMRI tasks (two × three tasks) were analyzed by two 
clinical neuropsychologists who flexibly thresholded and combined these to 
identify the six regions. The resulting maps were compared to fixed threshold 
maps. Clinicians generated maps that overlapped significantly, and were highly 
consistent, when at least one task came from the same set. Cases diverged when 
clinicians prioritized different language regions or addressed noise 
differently. Language laterality closely mirrored Wada data (85% accuracy). 
Activation consistent with all six language regions was consistently identified. 
In blind review, three external, independent clinicians rated the individualized 
fMRI language maps as superior to fixed threshold maps; identified the majority 
of regions significantly more frequently; and judged language laterality to 
mirror Wada lateralization more often. These data provide initial validation of 
a novel, clinician-based approach to localizing language cortex. They also 
demonstrate clinical fMRI is superior when analyzed by an experienced clinician 
and that when fMRI data is of low quality judgments of laterality are unreliable 
and should be withheld. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4239-4255, 2017. © 2017 Wiley

Alterations in neural networks are associated with the cognitive difficulties of 
the prematurely born. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we analyzed 
functional connectivity for preterm (PT) and term neonates at term equivalent 
age. Specifically, we constructed whole-brain networks and examined rich club 
(RC) organization, a common construct among complex systems where important (or 
"rich") nodes connect preferentially to other important nodes. Both PT and term 
neonates showed RC organization with PT neonates exhibiting significantly 
reduced connections between these RC nodes. Additionally, PT neonates showed 
evidence of weaker functional segregation. Our results suggest that PT birth is 
associated with fundamental changes of functional organization in the developing 
brain.

Although attention plays a ubiquitous role in perception and cognition, 
researchers lack a simple way to measure a person's overall attentional 
abilities. Because behavioral measures are diverse and difficult to standardize, 
we pursued a neuromarker of an important aspect of attention, sustained 
attention, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, we 
identified functional brain networks whose strength during a sustained attention 
task predicted individual differences in performance. Models based on these 
networks generalized to previously unseen individuals, even predicting 
performance from resting-state connectivity alone. Furthermore, these same 
models predicted a clinical measure of attention--symptoms of attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder--from resting-state connectivity in an independent sample 
of children and adolescents. These results demonstrate that whole-brain 
functional network strength provides a broadly applicable neuromarker of 
sustained attention.

PURPOSE: While O-Space imaging is well known to accelerate image acquisition 
beyond traditional Cartesian sampling, its advantages compared to undersampled 
radial imaging, the linear trajectory most akin to O-Space imaging, have not 
been detailed. In addition, previous studies have focused on ultrafast imaging 
with very high acceleration factors and relatively low resolution. The purpose 
of this work is to directly compare O-Space and radial imaging in their 
potential to deliver highly undersampled images of high resolution and minimal 
artifacts, as needed for diagnostic applications. We report that the greatest 
advantages to O-Space imaging are observed with extended data acquisition 
readouts.
THEORY AND METHODS: A sampling strategy that uses high resolution readouts is 
presented and applied to compare the potential of radial and O-Space sequences 
to generate high resolution images at high undersampling factors. Simulations 
and phantom studies were performed to investigate whether use of extended 
readout windows in O-Space imaging would increase k-space sampling and improve 
image quality, compared to radial imaging.
RESULTS: Experimental O-Space images acquired with high resolution readouts show 
fewer artifacts and greater sharpness than radial imaging with equivalent scan 
parameters. Radial images taken with longer readouts show stronger undersampling 
artifacts, which can cause small or subtle image features to disappear. These 
features are preserved in a comparable O-Space image.
CONCLUSIONS: High resolution O-Space imaging yields highly undersampled images 
of high resolution and minimal artifacts. The additional nonlinear gradient 
field improves image quality beyond conventional radial imaging.

PURPOSE: Nonlinear spatial encoding magnetic fields (SEMs) have been studied to 
reconstruct images from a minimum number of echoes. Previous work has also 
explored single shot trajectories in nonlinear SEMs. However, the search 
continues for optimal schemes that apply nonlinear SEMs to improve spatial 
encoding efficiency and image quality.
THEORY AND METHODS: We enhance the encoding efficiency of standard linear 
gradient trajectories by adding a rapidly rotating nonlinear SEM of moderate 
amplitude, the so called FRONSAC (Fast ROtary Nonlinear Spatial ACquisition) 
imaging. This additional gradient greatly improves the image quality of highly 
undersampled single-shot trajectories, including EPI, Spiral, and Rosette 
trajectories.
RESULTS: Our simulations, including noise and dephasing effects, test the effect 
of adding FRONSAC gradients, demonstrating the applicability of this approach. 
Performance is explained by demonstrating the additional k-space sampling the 
nonlinear gradient provides. Studies of the optimal amplitude and frequency of 
the additional FRONSAC field are presented, and the role of enhanced sampling 
during the readout demonstrated. Dynamic field mapping in a second-order 
gradient system shows the proposed gradient waveforms are feasible.
CONCLUSION: Images resulting from highly undersampled existing k-space 
trajectories, such as EPI, Spiral, and Rosette, are greatly enhanced simply by 
adding a rotating nonlinear SEM field.

OBJECTIVES: Emotion regulation difficulties precipitate and exacerbate acute 
mood symptoms in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and contribute to 
suicidal behavior. However, few studies have examined regional brain responses 
in explicit emotion regulation during acute BD mood states, or hopelessness, a 
major suicide risk factor. We assessed brain responses during explicit emotion 
regulation, and their relationship with hopelessness, in acutely symptomatic and 
euthymic individuals with BD.
METHODS: Functional MRI data were obtained from individuals with BD who were 
either in acute negative (BD-A; n = 24) or euthymic (BD-E; n = 24) mood states, 
and from healthy volunteers (HV; n = 55), while participants performed a 
paradigm that instructed them to downregulate their responses to fearful 
(EmReg-Fear) and happy (EmReg-Happy) facial stimuli. Emotion regulation-related 
differences in brain responses during negative and euthymic BD states, as well 
as their associations with negative affective symptoms (hopelessness and 
depression), were examined.
RESULTS: Decreased responses were observed in ventral and dorsal frontal 
regions, including medial orbitofrontal (mOFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortices, during EmReg-Fear across symptomatic and euthymic states in 
participants with BD relative to HVs. The lowest responses were observed in the 
BD-A group. Across BD participants, negative associations were observed between 
mOFC responses and hopelessness, particularly due to loss of motivation. 
Differences were not significant during EmReg-Happy.
CONCLUSIONS: Lesser emotion regulation-related ventral and dorsal frontal 
engagement in BD could represent a trait abnormality that worsens during acute 
negative states. The reduced mOFC engagement in BD during explicit regulation of 
negative emotions may contribute to hopelessness particularly in the context of 
diminished motivation.

Binge drinking and age at first full drink (AFD) of alcohol prior to 21 years 
(AFD < 21) have been linked to neuroanatomical differences in cortical and 
subcortical grey matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness, and surface area. 
Despite the importance of understanding network-level relationships, structural 
covariation patterns among these morphological measures have yet to be examined 
in relation to binge drinking and AFD < 21. Here, we used the Joint and 
Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) method to characterize structural 
covariation patterns common across and specific to morphological measures in 293 
participants (149 individuals with past-12-month binge drinking and 144 healthy 
controls) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). An independent dataset 
(Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample; NKI-RS) was used to examine 
reproducibility/generalizability. We identified a reproducible joint component 
dominated by structural covariation between GM volume in the brainstem and 
thalamus proper, and GM volume and surface area in prefrontal cortical regions. 
Using linear mixed regression models, we found that participants with AFD < 21 
showed lower joint component scores in both the HCP (beta = 0.059, 
p-value = 0.016; Cohen's d = 0.441) and NKI-RS (beta = 0.023, p-value = 0.040, 
Cohen's d = 0.216) datasets, whereas the individual thickness component 
associated with binge drinking (p-value = 0.02) and AFD < 21 (p-value < 0.001) 
in the HCP dataset was not statistically significant in the NKI-RS sample. Our 
findings were also generalizable to the HCP full sample (n = 880 participants). 
Taken together, our results show that use of JIVE analysis in high-dimensional, 
large-scale, psychiatry-related datasets led to discovery of a reproducible 
cortical and subcortical structural covariation pattern involving brain regions 
relevant to thalamic-PFC-brainstem neural circuitry which is related to AFD < 21 
and suggests a possible extension of existing addiction neurocircuitry in 
humans.

Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) aims to maximize resolvable information 
from functional brain scans by considering temporal changes in network 
structure. Recent work has demonstrated that static, i.e. time-invariant 
resting-state and task-based FC predicts individual differences in behavior, 
including attention. Here, we show that DFC predicts attention performance 
across individuals. Sliding-window FC matrices were generated from fMRI data 
collected during rest and attention task performance by calculating Pearson's r 
between every pair of nodes of a whole-brain atlas within overlapping 10-60s 
time segments. Next, variance in r values across windows was taken to quantify 
temporal variability in the strength of each connection, resulting in a DFC 
connectome for each individual. In a leave-one-subject-out-cross-validation 
approach, partial-least-square-regression (PLSR) models were then trained to 
predict attention task performance from DFC matrices. Predicted and observed 
attention scores were significantly correlated, indicating successful 
out-of-sample predictions across rest and task conditions. Combining DFC and 
static FC features numerically improves predictions over either model alone, but 
the improvement was not statistically significant. Moreover, dynamic and 
combined models generalized to two independent data sets (participants 
performing the Attention Network Task and the stop-signal task). Edges with 
significant PLSR coefficients concentrated in visual, motor, and 
executive-control brain networks; moreover, most of these coefficients were 
negative. Thus, better attention may rely on more stable, i.e. less variable, 
information flow between brain regions.

Although we typically talk about attention as a single process, it comprises 
multiple independent components. But what are these components, and how are they 
represented in the functional organization of the brain? To investigate whether 
long-studied components of attention are reflected in the brain's intrinsic 
functional organization, here we apply connectome-based predictive modeling 
(CPM) to predict the components of Posner and Petersen's influential model of 
attention: alerting (preparing and maintaining alertness and vigilance), 
orienting (directing attention to a stimulus), and executive control (detecting 
and resolving cognitive conflict) [Posner, M. I., & Petersen, S. E. The 
attention system of the human brain. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 13, 25-42, 
1990]. Participants performed the Attention Network Task (ANT), which measures 
these three factors, and rested during fMRI scanning. CPMs tested with 
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation successfully predicted novel individual's 
overall ANT accuracy, RT variability, and executive control scores from 
functional connectivity observed during ANT performance. CPMs also generalized 
to predict participants' alerting scores from their resting-state functional 
connectivity alone, demonstrating that connectivity patterns observed in the 
absence of an explicit task contain a signature of the ability to prepare for an 
upcoming stimulus. Suggesting that significant variance in ANT performance is 
also explained by an overall sustained attention factor, the sustained attention 
CPM, a model defined in prior work to predict sustained attentional abilities, 
predicted accuracy, RT variability, and executive control from task-based data 
and predicted RT variability from resting-state data. Our results suggest that, 
whereas executive control may be closely related to sustained attention, the 
infrastructure that supports alerting is distinct and can be measured at rest. 
In the future, CPM may be applied to elucidate additional independent components 
of attention and relationships between the functional brain networks that

Active coping underlies a healthy stress response, but neural processes 
supporting such resilient coping are not well-known. Using a brief, sustained 
exposure paradigm contrasting highly stressful, threatening, and violent stimuli 
versus nonaversive neutral visual stimuli in a functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) study, we show significant subjective, physiologic, and endocrine 
increases and temporally related dynamically distinct patterns of neural 
activation in brain circuits underlying the stress response. First, 
stress-specific sustained increases in the amygdala, striatum, hypothalamus, 
midbrain, right insula, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions 
supported the stress processing and reactivity circuit. Second, dynamic neural 
activation during stress versus neutral runs, showing early increases followed 
by later reduced activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), left DLPFC, hippocampus, and left 
insula, suggested a stress adaptation response network. Finally, dynamic 
stress-specific mobilization of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC), 
marked by initial hypoactivity followed by increased VmPFC activation, pointed 
to the VmPFC as a key locus of the emotional and behavioral control network. 
Consistent with this finding, greater neural flexibility signals in the VmPFC 
during stress correlated with active coping ratings whereas lower dynamic 
activity in the VmPFC also predicted a higher level of maladaptive coping 
behaviors in real life, including binge alcohol intake, emotional eating, and 
frequency of arguments and fights. These findings demonstrate acute functional 
neuroplasticity during stress, with distinct and separable brain networks that 
underlie critical components of the stress response, and a specific role for 
VmPFC neuroflexibility in stress-resilient coping.

It is a longstanding goal of neuroimaging to produce reliable, generalizable 
models of brain behavior relationships. More recently, data driven predictive 
models have become popular. However, overfitting is a common problem with 
statistical models, which impedes model generalization. Cross validation (CV) is 
often used to estimate expected model performance within sample. Yet, the best 
way to generate brain behavior models, and apply them out-of-sample, on an 
unseen dataset, is unclear. As a solution, this study proposes an ensemble 
learning method, in this case resample aggregating, encompassing both model 
parameter estimation and feature selection. Here we investigate the use of 
resampled aggregated models when used to estimate fluid intelligence (fIQ) from 
fMRI based functional connectivity (FC) data. We take advantage of two large 
openly available datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and the 
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). We generate aggregated and 
non-aggregated models of fIQ in the HCP, using the Connectome Prediction 
Modelling (CPM) framework. Over various test-train splits, these models are 
evaluated in sample, on left-out HCP data, and out-of-sample, on PNC data. We 
find that a resample aggregated model performs best both within- and 
out-of-sample. We also find that feature selection can vary substantially 
within-sample. More robust feature selection methods, as detailed here, are 
needed to improve cross sample performance of CPM based brain behavior models.

Recent work has demonstrated that human whole-brain functional connectivity 
patterns measured with fMRI contain information about cognitive abilities, 
including sustained attention. To derive behavioral predictions from 
connectivity patterns, our group developed a connectome-based predictive 
modeling (CPM) approach (Finn et al., 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2016). Previously 
using CPM, we defined a high-attention network, comprising connections 
positively correlated with performance on a sustained attention task, and a 
low-attention network, comprising connections negatively correlated with 
performance. Validating the networks as generalizable biomarkers of attention, 
models based on network strength at rest predicted 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in an independent group 
of individuals (Rosenberg et al., 2016). To investigate whether these networks 
play a causal role in attention, here we examined their strength in healthy 
adults given methylphenidate (Ritalin), a common ADHD treatment, compared with 
unmedicated controls. As predicted, individuals given methylphenidate showed 
patterns of connectivity associated with better sustained attention: higher 
high-attention and lower low-attention network strength than controls. There was 
significant overlap between the high-attention network and a network with 
greater strength in the methylphenidate group, and between the low-attention 
network and a network with greater strength in the control group. Network 
strength also predicted behavior on a stop-signal task, such that participants 
with higher go response rates showed higher high-attention and lower 
low-attention network strength. These results suggest that methylphenidate acts 
by modulating functional brain networks related to sustained attention, and that 
changing whole-brain connectivity patterns may help improve attention.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent work identified a promising neuromarker of 
sustained attention based on whole-brain functional connectivity networks. To 
investigate the causal role of these networks in attention, we examined their 
response to a dose of methylphenidate, a common and effective treatment for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, in healthy adults. As predicted, 
individuals on methylphenidate showed connectivity signatures of better 
sustained attention: higher high-attention and lower low-attention network 
strength than controls. These results suggest that methylphenidate acts by 
modulating strength in functional brain networks related to attention, and that 
changing whole-brain connectivity patterns may improve attention.

Brain functional connectivity features can predict cognition and behavior at the 
level of the individual. Most studies measure univariate signals, correlating 
timecourses from the average of constituent voxels in each node. While 
straightforward, this approach overlooks the spatial patterns of voxel-wise 
signals within individual nodes. Given that multivariate spatial activity 
patterns across voxels can improve fMRI measures of mental representations, here 
we asked whether using voxel-wise timecourses can better characterize 
region-by-region interactions relative to univariate approaches. Using two fMRI 
datasets, the Human Connectome Project sample and a local test-retest sample, we 
measured multivariate functional connectivity with multivariate distance 
correlation and univariate connectivity with Pearson's correlation. We compared 
multivariate and univariate connectivity estimates, demonstrating that relative 
to univariate estimates, multivariate estimates exhibited higher reliability at 
both the edge-level and connectome-level, stronger prediction of individual 
differences, and greater sensitivity to brain states within individuals. Our 
findings suggest that multivariate estimates reliably provide more powerful 
information about an individual's functional brain organization and its relation 
to cognitive skills.

Individuals born prematurely are at risk for developmental delay, and converging 
data suggest alterations in neural networks in the developing preterm brain. 
Nevertheless, those critical period processes such as cerebral lateralization 
that underlie these findings remain largely unexplored. To test the hypothesis 
that preterm birth alters the fundamental program of corticogenesis in the 
developing brain, we interrogated cerebral lateralization at rest in very 
prematurely born participants and term controls at young adulthood. Employing a 
novel, voxel-based measure of functional connectivity, these data demonstrate 
for the first time that cerebral lateralization of functional connectivity in 
right hemisphere language homologs is altered for very preterm participants. 
Very preterm participants with no evidence for severe brain injury exhibited a 
significant decrease in right hemisphere lateralization in the right parietal 
and temporal lobes in this data driven analysis. Further, for the very preterm 
participants, but not the term participants, these fundamental alterations in 
the cerebral lateralization for language significantly correlate with language 
scores. These findings provide evidence that cerebral asymmetry is both plastic 
and experiential, and suggest the need for further study of underlying 
environmental factors responsible for these changes.

The personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion are strongly 
associated with emotional experience and affective disorders. Previous studies 
reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity correlates of 
these traits, but no study has used brain-based measures to predict them. Here, 
using a fully cross-validated approach, we predict novel individuals' 
neuroticism and extraversion from functional connectivity (FC) data observed as 
they simply rested during fMRI scanning. We applied a data-driven technique, 
connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), to resting-state FC data and 
neuroticism and extraversion scores (self-reported NEO Five Factor Inventory) 
from 114 participants of the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland sample. After 
dividing the whole brain into 268 nodes using a predefined functional atlas, we 
defined each individual's FC matrix as the set of correlations between the 
activity timecourses of every pair of nodes. CPM identified networks consisting 
of functional connections correlated with neuroticism and extraversion scores, 
and used strength in these networks to predict a left-out individual's scores. 
CPM predicted neuroticism and extraversion in novel individuals, demonstrating 
that patterns in resting-state FC reveal trait-level measures of personality. 
CPM also revealed predictive networks that exhibit some anatomical patterns 
consistent with past studies and potential new brain areas of interest in 
personality.

OBJECT: Sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (sNSC) is the most common form of 
NSC. The condition is associated with a high prevalence (> 50%) of deficits in 
executive function. The authors employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 
functional MRI to evaluate whether hypothesized structural and functional 
connectivity differences underlie the observed neurocognitive morbidity of sNSC.
METHODS: Using a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI system, the authors collected DTI and 
resting-state functional connectivity MRI data in 8 adolescent patients (mean 
age 12.3 years) with sNSC that had been previously corrected via total vault 
cranioplasty and 8 control children (mean age 12.3 years) without 
craniosynostosis. Data were analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library and 
BioImageSuite.
RESULTS: Analyses of the DTI data revealed white matter alterations approaching 
statistical significance in all supratentorial lobes. Statistically significant 
group differences (sNSC < control group) in mean diffusivity were localized to 
the right supramarginal gyrus. Analysis of the resting-state seed in relation to 
whole-brain data revealed significant increases in negative connectivity 
(anticorrelations) of Brodmann area 8 to the prefrontal cortex (Montreal 
Neurological Institute [MNI] center of mass coordinates [x, y, z]: -6, 53, 6) 
and anterior cingulate cortex (MNI coordinates 6, 43, 14) in the sNSC group 
relative to controls. Furthermore, in the sNSC patients versus controls, the 
Brodmann area 7, 39, and 40 seed had decreased connectivity to left angular 
gyrus (MNI coordinates -31, -61, 34), posterior cingulate cortex (MNI 
coordinates 13, -52, 18), precuneus (MNI coordinates 10, -55, 54), left and 
right parahippocampus (MNI coordinates -13, -52, 2 and MNI coordinates 11, -50, 
2, respectively), lingual (MNI coordinates -11, -86, -10), and fusiform gyri 
(MNI coordinates -30, -79, -18). Intrinsic connectivity analysis also revealed 
altered connectivity between central nodes in the default mode network in sNSC 
relative to controls; the left and right posterior cingulate cortices (MNI 
coordinates -5, -35, 34 and MNI coordinates 6, -42, 39, respectively) were 
negatively correlated to right hemisphere precuneus (MNI coordinates 6, -71, 
46), while the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (MNI coordinates 6, 34, -8) 
was negatively correlated to right middle frontal gyrus (MNI coordinates 40, 4, 
33). All group comparisons (sNSC vs controls) were conducted at a whole 
brain-corrected threshold of p < 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates altered neocortical structural and 
functional connectivity in sNSC that may, in part or substantially, underlie the 
neuropsychological deficits commonly reported in this population. Future studies 
combining analysis of multimodal MRI and clinical characterization data in 
larger samples of participants are warranted.

OBJECT Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) is associated with significant 
learning disability later in life. Surgical reconstruction is typically 
performed before 1 year of age to correct the cranial vault morphology and to 
allow for normalized brain growth with the goal of improving cognitive function. 
Yet, no studies have assessed to what extent normalized brain growth is actually 
achieved. Recent advances in MRI have allowed for automated methods of 
objectively assessing subtle and pronounced brain morphological differences. The 
authors used one such technique, deformation-based morphometry (DBM) Jacobian 
mapping, to determine how previously treated adolescents with sagittal NSC 
(sNSC) significantly differ in brain anatomy compared with healthy matched 
controls up to 11.5 years after surgery. METHODS Eight adolescent patients with 
sNSC, previously treated via whole-vault cranioplasty at a mean age of 7 months, 
and 8 age- and IQ-matched control subjects without craniosynostosis (mean age 
for both groups = 12.3 years), underwent functional 3-T MRI. Statistically 
significant group tissue-volume differences were assessed using DBM, a 
whole-brain technique that estimates morphological differences between 2 groups 
at each voxel (p < 0.01). Group-wise Jacobian volume maps were generated using a 
spacing of 1.5 mm and a resolution of 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05 mm(3). RESULTS There 
were no significant areas of volume reduction or expansion in any brain areas in 
adolescents with sNSC compared with controls at a significance level of p < 
0.01. At the more liberal threshold of p < 0.05, two areas of brain expansion 
extending anteroposteriorly in the right temporooccipital and left 
frontoparietal regions appeared in patients with sNSC compared with controls. 
CONCLUSIONS Compared with previous reports on untreated infants with sNSC, 
adolescents with sNSC in this cohort had few areas of brain dysmorphology many 
years after surgery. This result suggests that comprehensive cranioplasty 
performed at an early age offers substantial brain normalization by adolescence, 
but also that some effects of vault constriction may still persist after 
treatment. Specifically, few areas of expansion in frontoparietal and 
temporooccipital regions may persist. Overall, data from this small cohort 
support the primary goal of surgery in allowing for more normalized brain 
growth. Larger samples, and correlating degree of normalization with cognitive 
performance in NSC, are warranted.

Exposure to prenatal and early-life stress results in alterations in neural 
connectivity and an increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. In 
particular, alterations in amygdala connectivity have emerged as a common effect 
across several recent studies. However, the impact of prenatal stress exposure 
on the functional organization of the amygdala has yet to be explored in the 
prematurely-born, a population at high risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. We 
test the hypothesis that preterm birth and prenatal exposure to maternal stress 
alter functional connectivity of the amygdala using two independent cohorts. The 
first cohort is used to establish the effects of preterm birth and consists of 
12 very preterm neonates and 25 term controls, all without prenatal stress 
exposure. The second is analyzed to establish the effects of prenatal stress 
exposure and consists of 16 extremely preterm neonates with prenatal stress 
exposure and 10 extremely preterm neonates with no known prenatal stress 
exposure. Standard resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed 
connectivity methods are used. When compared to term controls, very preterm 
neonates show significantly reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the 
thalamus, the hypothalamus, the brainstem, and the insula (p < 0.05). Similarly, 
when compared to extremely preterm neonates without exposure to prenatal stress, 
extremely preterm neonates with exposure to prenatal stress show significantly 
less connectivity between the left amygdala and the thalamus, the hypothalamus, 
and the peristriate cortex (p < 0.05). Exploratory analysis of the combined 
cohorts suggests additive effects of prenatal stress on alterations in amygdala 
connectivity associated with preterm birth. Functional connectivity from the 
amygdala to other subcortical regions is decreased in preterm neonates compared 
to term controls. In addition, these data, for the first time, suggest that 
prenatal stress exposure amplifies these decreases.

PURPOSE: Turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging reduces imaging time by acquiring 
multiple echoes per repetition (TR), requiring fewer TRs. O-space can also 
require fewer TRs by using a combination of nonlinear magnetic gradient fields 
and surface coil arrays. Although to date, O-space has only been demonstrated 
for gradient echo imaging, it is valuable to combine these two techniques. 
However, collecting multiple O-space echoes per TR is difficult because of the 
different local k-space trajectories and variable T2-weighting.
THEORY AND METHODS: A practical scheme is demonstrated to combine the benefits 
of TSE and O-space for highly accelerated T2-weighted images. The scheme uses a 
modified acquisition order and filtered projection reconstruction to reduce 
artifacts caused by T2 decay, while retaining T2 contrast that corresponds to a 
specific echo time.
RESULTS: The experiments revealed that the proposed method can produce highly 
accelerated T2-weighted images. Moreover, the method can generate multiple 
images with different T2 contrasts from a single dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed O-space TSE imaging method requires fewer echoes than 
conventional TSE and fewer repetitions than conventional O-space imaging. It 
retains resilience to undersampling, clearly outperforming Cartesian SENSE at 
high levels of undersampling, and can generate undistorted images with a range 
of T2 contrast from a single acquired dataset.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is linked to addiction and obesity 
vulnerability. Neural responses to stressful and appetitive cues in adolescents 
with PCE versus those without have been differentially linked to substance-use 
initiation. However, no prior studies have assessed cue-reactivity responses 
among PCE adolescents using a connectivity-based approach.
METHODS: Twenty-two PCE and 22 non-prenatally drug-exposed (NDE) age-, sex-, IQ- 
and BMI-matched adolescents participated in individualized guided imagery with 
appetitive (favorite-food), stressful and neutral-relaxing cue scripts during 
functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjective favorite-food craving scores 
were collected before and after script exposure. A data-driven voxel-wise 
intrinsic connectivity distribution analysis was used to identify between-group 
differences and examine relationships with craving scores.
RESULTS: A group-by-cue interaction effect identified a parietal lobe cluster 
where PCE versus NDE adolescents showed less connectivity during stressful and 
more connectivity during neutral-relaxing conditions. Follow-up seed-based 
connectivity analyses revealed that, among PCE adolescents, the parietal seed 
was positively connected to inferior parietal and sensory areas and negatively 
connected to corticolimbic during both stress and neutral-relaxing conditions. 
For NDE, greater parietal connectivity to parietal, cingulate and sensory areas 
and lesser parietal connectivity to medial prefrontal areas were found during 
stress compared to neutral-relaxing cueing. Craving scores inversely correlated 
with corticolimbic connectivity in PCE, but not NDE adolescents, during the 
favorite-food condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this first data-driven intrinsic connectivity 
analysis of PCE influences on adolescent brain function indicate differences 
relating to PCE status and craving. These findings provide insight into the 
developmental impact of in utero drug exposure.

It has been suggested that neurological problems more frequent in those born 
preterm are expressed prior to birth, but owing to technical limitations, this 
has been difficult to test in humans. We applied novel fetal resting-state 
functional MRI to measure brain function in 32 human fetuses in utero and found 
that systems-level neural functional connectivity was diminished in fetuses that 
would subsequently be born preterm. Neural connectivity was reduced in a 
left-hemisphere pre-language region, and the degree to which connectivity of 
this left language region extended to right-hemisphere homologs was positively 
associated with the time elapsed between fMRI assessment and delivery. These 
results provide the first evidence that altered functional connectivity in the 
preterm brain is identifiable before birth. They suggest that neurodevelopmental 
disorders associated with preterm birth may result from neurological insults 
that begin in utero.

The test-retest reliability of functional neuroimaging data has recently been a 
topic of much discussion. Despite early conflicting reports, converging reports 
now suggest that test-retest reliability is poor for standard univariate 
measures-namely, voxel- and region-level task-based activation and edge-level 
functional connectivity. To better understand the implications of these recent 
studies requires understanding the nuances of test-retest reliability as 
commonly measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Here we 
provide a guide to the measurement and interpretation of test-retest reliability 
in functional neuroimaging and review major findings in the literature. We 
highlight the importance of making choices that improve reliability so long as 
they do not diminish validity, pointing to the potential of multivariate 
approaches that improve both. Finally, we discuss the implications of recent 
reports of low test-retest reliability in the context of ongoing work in the 
field.

PURPOSE: To investigate an ECG-gated dynamic-flip-angle BOLD sequence with 
improved robustness against cardiogenic noise in resting-state fMRI.
METHODS: ECG-gating minimizes the cardiogenic noise but introduces T1 -dependent 
signal variation, which is minimized by combination of a dynamic-flip-angle 
technique and retrospective nuisance signal regression (NSR) using signals of 
white matter, CSF, and global average. The technique was studied with 
simulations in a wide range of T1 and B1 fields and phantom imaging with 
pre-programmed TR variations. Resting-state fMRI of 20 healthy subjects was 
acquired with non-gated BOLD (NG), ECG-gated constant-flip-angle BOLD (GCFA), 
ECG-gated BOLD with retrospective T1 -correction (GRC), and ECG-gated 
dynamic-flip-angle BOLD (GDFA), all processed by the same NSR method. GDFA was 
compared to alternative methods over temporal SNR (tSNR), seed-based 
connectivity, and whole-brain voxelwise connectivity based on intrinsic 
connectivity distribution (ICD). A previous large-cohort data set (N = 100) was 
used as a connectivity gold standard.
RESULTS: Simulations and phantom imaging show substantial reduction of the T1 
-dependent signal variation with GDFA alone, and further reduction with NSR. The 
resting-state study shows improved tSNR in the basal brain, comparing GDFA to 
NG, after both processed with NSR. Furthermore, GDFA significantly improved 
subcortical-subcortical and cortical-subcortical connectivity for several 
representative seeds and significantly improved ICD in the brainstem, thalamus, 
striatum, and prefrontal cortex, compared to the other 3 approaches.
CONCLUSION: GDFA with NSR improves mapping of the resting-state functional 
connectivity of the basal-brain regions by reducing cardiogenic noise.

The supplementary motor area coordinates movements. Synkinesia is a rare 
disorder in which an involuntary movement occurs coordinated with a voluntary 
movement. Here, we test the hypothesis that the supplementary motor area is 
involved in involuntary coordination of movement. We collected functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two patients with ipsilateral 
hand-foot synkinesia and two control participants while they performed rhythmic 
tasks. In synkinesia patients, both the supplementary motor area and the foot 
motor cortex were significantly activated during the hand motor task. This 
pattern was not seen in controls. Our findings suggest that the supplementary 
motor area plays a central role in involuntary coordination observed in 
synkinesia, and provides insight into how the supplementary motor area 
orchestrates movements.

The large-scale organization of the brain has features of complex networks that 
can be quantified using network measures from graph theory. However, many 
network measures were designed to be calculated on binary graphs, whereas 
functional brain organization is typically inferred from a continuous measure of 
correlations in temporal signal between brain regions. Thresholding is a 
necessary step to use binary graphs derived from functional connectivity data. 
However, there is no current consensus on what threshold to use, and network 
measures and group contrasts may be unstable across thresholds. Nevertheless, 
whole-brain network analyses are being applied widely with findings typically 
reported at an arbitrary threshold or range of thresholds. This study sought to 
evaluate the stability of network measures across thresholds in a large resting 
state functional connectivity dataset. Network measures were evaluated across 
absolute (correlation-based) and proportional (sparsity-based) thresholds, and 
compared between sex and age groups. Overall, network measures were found to be 
unstable across absolute thresholds. For example, the direction of group 
differences in a given network measure may change depending on the threshold. 
Network measures were found to be more stable across proportional thresholds. 
These results demonstrate that caution should be used when applying thresholds 
to functional connectivity data and when interpreting results from binary graph 
models.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical data demonstrate that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
interneurons initiate connectivity in the developing brain.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare GABA concentration and its 
relationship to functional connectivity in the brains of term and preterm 
infants at term-equivalent age.
METHODS: Infants received both magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at term-equivalent age. Whole 
brain functional connectivity MRI data using intrinsic connectivity distribution 
maps were compared to identify areas with differences in resting-state 
functional connectivity between the preterm and term control groups. MRS 
measured concentrations of GABA, glutamate, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and 
choline; NAA/choline was then calculated for comparison between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Preterm infants had lower right frontal GABA and glutamate 
concentrations than term controls and showed a significantly different 
relationship between connectivity and GABA concentration in the right frontal 
lobe. Preterm infants had a positive correlation between GABA concentration and 
connectivity, while term controls demonstrated a negative correlation between 
these two developmentally regulated parameters.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that regional GABA concentrations are 
associated with normal and altered neonatal resting-state connectivity.

The North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative represents 
a network of 27 academic centers focused on accelerating the pace of magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) research in multiple sclerosis (MS) through idea 
exchange and collaboration. Recently, NAIMS completed its first project 
evaluating the feasibility of implementation and reproducibility of quantitative 
MRI measures derived from scanning a single MS patient using a high-resolution 
3T protocol at seven sites. The results showed the feasibility of utilizing 
advanced quantitative MRI measures in multicenter studies and demonstrated the 
importance of careful standardization of scanning protocols, central image 
processing, and strategies to account for inter-site variability.

Alcohol dependence is a chronic relapsing illness. Alcohol and stress cues have 
consistently been shown to increase craving and relapse risk in recovering 
alcohol dependent (AUD) patients. However, differences in functional 
connectivity in response to these cues have not been studied using data-driven 
approaches. Here, voxel-wise connectivity is used in a whole-brain investigation 
of functional connectivity differences associated with alcohol and stress cues 
and to examine whether these differences are related to subsequent relapse. In 
Study 1, 45, 4- to 8-week abstinent, recovering AUD patients underwent 
functional magnetic resonance imaging during individualized imagery of alcohol, 
stress, and neutral cues. Relapse measures were collected prospectively for 
90 days post-discharge from inpatient treatment. AUD patients showed blunted 
anterior (ACC), mid (MCC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), voxel-wise 
connectivity responses to stress compared to neutral cues and blunted PCC 
response to alcohol compared to neutral cues. Using Cox proportional hazard 
regression, weaker connectivity in ACC and MCC during neutral exposure was 
associated with longer time to relapse (better recovery outcome). Similarly, 
greater connectivity in PCC during alcohol-cue compared to stress cue was 
associated with longer time to relapse. In Study 2, a sub-group of 30 AUD 
patients were demographically-matched to 30 healthy control (HC) participants 
for group comparisons. AUD compared to HC participants showed reduced cingulate 
connectivity during alcohol and stress cues. Using novel data-driven approaches, 
the cingulate cortex emerged as a key region in the disruption of functional 
connectivity during alcohol and stress-cue processing in AUD patients and as a 
marker of subsequent alcohol relapse.

BACKGROUND: Among nondiabetic individuals, mild glucose decrements alter brain 
activity in regions linked to reward, motivation, and executive control. Whether 
these effects differ in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with and 
without hypoglycemia awareness remains unclear.
METHODS: Forty-two individuals (13 healthy control [HC] subjects, 16 T1DM 
individuals with hypoglycemia awareness [T1DM-Aware], and 13 T1DM individuals 
with hypoglycemia unawareness [T1DM-Unaware]) underwent blood oxygen 
level-dependent functional MRI brain imaging during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic (90 mg/dl)-hypoglycemic (60 mg/dl) clamp for assessment of neural 
responses to mild hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: Mild hypoglycemia in HC subjects altered activity in the caudate, 
insula, prefrontal cortex, and angular gyrus, whereas T1DM-Aware subjects showed 
no caudate and insula changes, but showed altered activation patterns in the 
prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus. Most strikingly, in direct contrast to HC 
and T1DM-Aware subjects, T1DM-Unaware subjects failed to show any 
hypoglycemia-induced changes in brain activity. These findings were also 
associated with blunted hormonal counterregulatory responses and hypoglycemia 
symptom scores during mild hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSION: In T1DM, and in particular T1DM-Unaware patients, there is a 
progressive blunting of brain responses in cortico-striatal and fronto-parietal 
neurocircuits in response to mild-moderate hypoglycemia. These findings have 
implications for understanding why individuals with impaired hypoglycemia 
awareness fail to respond appropriately to falling blood glucose levels.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) are associated with complex changes as revealed by functional 
magnetic resonance imaging. To date, neuroimaging-based models are not able to 
characterize individuals with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Further, 
although evidence shows that ADHD traits occur in individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder, and autism spectrum disorder traits in individuals with ADHD, 
the neurofunctional basis of the overlap is undefined.
METHODS: Using individuals from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and 
ADHD-200, we apply a data-driven, subject-level approach, connectome-based 
predictive modeling, to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data 
to identify brain-behavior associations that are predictive of symptom severity. 
We examine cross-diagnostic commonalities and differences.
RESULTS: Using leave-one-subject-out and split-half analyses, we define networks 
that predict Social Responsiveness Scale, Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule, and ADHD Rating Scale scores and confirm that these networks 
generalize to novel subjects. Networks share minimal overlap of edges (<2%) but 
some common regions of high hubness (Brodmann areas 10, 11, and 21, cerebellum, 
and thalamus). Further, predicted Social Responsiveness Scale scores for 
individuals with ADHD are linked to ADHD symptoms, supporting the hypothesis 
that brain organization relevant to autism spectrum disorder severity shares a 
component associated with attention in ADHD. Predictive connections and 
high-hubness regions are found within a wide range of brain areas and across 
conventional networks.
CONCLUSIONS: An individual's functional connectivity profile contains 
information that supports dimensional, nonbinary classification in autism 
spectrum disorder and ADHD. Furthermore, we can determine disorder-specific and 
shared neurofunctional pathology using our method.

Alterations in neural structure have been reported in both cocaine-use disorder 
and gambling disorder, separately, suggesting similarities across addiction 
diagnoses. Individual variation in neural structure has also been associated 
with impulsivity, a dimensional construct implicated in addictions. This study 
combines categorical (diagnosis-based) and dimensional (transdiagnostic) 
approaches to identify neural structural alterations linked to addiction 
subtypes and trait impulsivity, respectively, across individuals with gambling 
disorder (n = 35), individuals with cocaine-use disorder (n = 37) and healthy 
comparison individuals (n = 37). High-resolution T1-weighted data were analyzed 
using modulated voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Statistical analyses were 
conducted using whole-brain general-linear models, corrected for family-wise 
error (pFWE < .05). Categorical analyses indicated a main effect of diagnostic 
group on prefrontal (dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex) gray matter volumes (GMVs), involving decreased GMVs among cocaine-use 
disorder participants only. Dimensional analyses indicated a negative 
association between trait impulsivity and cortical (insula) and subcortical 
(amygdala and hippocampus) GMVs across all participants. Conjunction analysis 
indicated little anatomical overlap between regions identified as 
differentiating diagnostic groups and regions covarying with impulsivity. These 
data provide first evidence of neural structural differences between gambling 
disorder and an illicit substance-use disorder. They further indicate 
dissociable effects of diagnostic groupings and trait impulsivity on neural 
structure among individuals with behavioral and drug addictions. Study findings 
highlight the importance of considering both categorical and dimensional (e.g. 
Research Domain Criteria; RDoC) analysis approaches within the context of 
addictions research.

Individuals often interpret the same event in different ways. How do personality 
traits modulate brain activity evoked by a complex stimulus? Here we report 
results from a naturalistic paradigm designed to draw out both neural and 
behavioral variation along a specific dimension of interest, namely paranoia. 
Participants listen to a narrative during functional MRI describing an ambiguous 
social scenario, written such that some individuals would find it highly 
suspicious, while others less so. Using inter-subject correlation analysis, we 
identify several brain areas that are differentially synchronized during 
listening between participants with high and low trait-level paranoia, including 
theory-of-mind regions. Follow-up analyses indicate that these regions are more 
active to mentalizing events in high-paranoia individuals. Analyzing 
participants' speech as they freely recall the narrative reveals semantic and 
syntactic features that also scale with paranoia. Results indicate that a 
personality trait can act as an intrinsic "prime," yielding different neural and 
behavioral responses to the same stimulus across individuals.

Prematurely born children are at increased risk for cognitive deficits, but the 
neurobiological basis of these findings remains poorly understood. Because 
variations in neural circuitry may influence performance on cognitive tasks, 
recent investigations have explored the impact of preterm birth on connectivity 
in the developing brain. Diffusion tensor imaging studies demonstrate widespread 
alterations in fractional anisotropy, a measure of axonal integrity and 
microstructural connectivity, throughout the developing preterm brain. 
Functional connectivity studies report that preterm neonates, children and 
adolescents exhibit alterations in both resting state and task-based 
connectivity when compared with term control subjects. Taken together, these 
data suggest that neurodevelopmental impairment following preterm birth may 
represent a disease of neural connectivity.

What is the neural basis of individual differences in the ability to hold 
information in long-term memory (LTM)? Here, we first characterize two 
whole-brain functional connectivity networks based on fMRI data acquired during 
an n-back task that robustly predict individual differences in two important 
forms of LTM, recognition and recollection. We then focus on the recognition 
memory model and contrast it with a working memory model. Although functional 
connectivity during the n-back task also predicts working memory performance and 
the two networks have some shared components, they are also largely distinct 
from each other: The recognition memory model performance remains robust when we 
control for working memory, and vice versa. Functional connectivity only within 
regions traditionally associated with LTM formation, such as the medial temporal 
lobe and those that show univariate subsequent memory effect, have little 
predictive power for both forms of LTM. Interestingly, the interactions between 
these regions and other brain regions play a more substantial role in predicting 
recollection memory than recognition memory. These results demonstrate that 
individual differences in LTM are dependent on the configuration of a 
whole-brain functional network including but not limited to regions associated 
with LTM during encoding and that such a network is separable from what supports 
the retention of information in working memory.

INTRODUCTION: Working memory is a critical cognitive ability that affects our 
daily functioning and relates to many cognitive processes and clinical 
conditions. Episodic memory is vital because it enables individuals to form and 
maintain their self-identities. Our study analyzes the extent to which 
whole-brain functional connectivity observed during completion of an N-back 
memory task, a common measure of working memory, can predict both working memory 
and episodic memory.
METHODS: We used connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) to predict 502 Human 
Connectome Project (HCP) participants' in-scanner 2-back memory test scores and 
out-of-scanner working memory test (List Sorting) and episodic memory test 
(Picture Sequence and Penn Word) scores based on functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) data collected both during rest and N-back task performance. We 
also analyzed the functional brain connections that contributed to prediction 
for each of these models.
RESULTS: Functional connectivity observed during N-back task performance 
predicted out-of-scanner List Sorting scores and to a lesser extent 
out-of-scanner Picture Sequence scores, but did not predict out-of-scanner Penn 
Word scores. Additionally, the functional connections predicting 2-back scores 
overlapped to a greater degree with those predicting List Sorting scores than 
with those predicting Picture Sequence or Penn Word scores. Functional 
connections with the insula, including connections between insular and parietal 
regions, predicted scores across the 2-back, List Sorting, and Picture Sequence 
tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings validate functional connectivity observed during the 
N-back task as a measure of working memory, which generalizes to predict 
episodic memory to a lesser extent. By building on our understanding of the 
predictive power of N-back task functional connectivity, this work enhances our 
knowledge of relationships between working memory and episodic memory.

Blood glucose levels influence brain regulation of food intake. This study 
assessed the effect of mild physiological hyperglycemia on brain response to 
food cues in individuals with obesity (OB) versus normal weight individuals 
(NW). Brain responses in 10 OB and 10 NW nondiabetic healthy adults [body mass 
index: 34 (3) vs. 23 (2) kg/m2, means (SD), P < 0.0001] were measured with 
functional MRI (blood oxygen level-dependent contrast) in combination with a 
two-step normoglycemic-hyperglycemic clamp. Participants were shown food and 
nonfood images during normoglycemia (~95 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (~130 mg/dl). 
Plasma glucose levels were comparable in both groups during the two-step clamp ( 
P = not significant). Insulin and leptin levels were higher in the OB group 
compared with NW, whereas ghrelin levels were lower (all P < 0.05). During 
hyperglycemia, insula activity showed a group-by-glucose level effect. When 
compared with normoglycemia, hyperglycemia resulted in decreased activity in the 
hypothalamus and putamen in response to food images ( P < 0.001) in the NW 
group, whereas the OB group exhibited increased activity in insula, putamen, and 
anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (aPFC/dlPFC; P < 0.001). These data 
suggest that OB, compared with NW, appears to have disruption of brain responses 
to food cues during hyperglycemia, with reduced insula response in NW but 
increased insula response in OB, an area involved in food perception and 
interoception. In a post hoc analysis, brain activity in obesity appears to be 
associated with dysregulated motivation (striatum) and inappropriate 
self-control (aPFC/dlPFC) to food cues during hyperglycemia. Hyperstimulation 
for food and insensitivity to internal homeostatic signals may favor food 
consumption to possibly play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity.

A recent study by Waller and colleagues evaluated the reliability, specificity, 
and generalizability of using functional connectivity data to identify 
individuals from a group. The authors note they were able to replicate 
identification rates in a larger version of the original Human Connectome 
Project (HCP) dataset. However, they also report lower identification accuracies 
when using historical neuroimaging acquisitions with low spatial and temporal 
resolution. The authors suggest that their results indicate connectomes derived 
from historical imaging data may be similar across individuals, to the extent 
that this connectome-based approach may be inappropriate for precision 
psychiatry and the goal of drawing inferences based on subject-level data. Here 
we note that the authors did not take into account factors affecting data 
quality and hence identification rates, independent of whether a low 
spatiotemporal resolution acquisition or a high spatiotemporal resolution 
acquisition is used. Specifically, we show here that the amount of data 
collected per subject and in-scanner motion are the predominant factors 
influencing identification rates, not the spatiotemporal resolution of the 
acquisition. To do this, we investigated identification rates in the HCP dataset 
as a function of the amount of data and motion. Using a dataset from the 
Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), we investigated the 
impact of multiband versus non-multiband imaging parameters; that is, high 
spatiotemporal resolution versus low spatiotemporal resolution acquisitions. We 
show scan length and motion affect identification, whereas the imaging protocol 
does not affect these rates. Our results suggest that motion and amount of data 
per subject are the primary factors impacting individual connectivity profiles, 
but that within these constraints, individual differences in the connectome are 
readily observable.

The goal of this study was to document current clinical practice and report 
patient outcomes in presurgical language functional MRI (fMRI) for epilepsy 
surgery. Epilepsy surgical programs worldwide were surveyed as to the utility, 
implementation, and efficacy of language fMRI in the clinic; 82 programs 
responded. Respondents were predominantly US (61%) academic programs (85%), and 
evaluated adults (44%), adults and children (40%), or children only (16%). 
Nearly all (96%) reported using language fMRI. Surprisingly, fMRI is used to 
guide surgical margins (44% of programs) as well as lateralize language (100%). 
Sites using fMRI for localization most often use a distance margin around 
activation of 10mm. While considered useful, 56% of programs reported at least 
one instance of disagreement with other measures. Direct brain stimulation 
typically confirmed fMRI findings (74%) when guiding margins, but instances of 
unpredicted decline were reported by 17% of programs and 54% reported unexpected 
preservation of function. Programs reporting unexpected decline did not clearly 
differ from those which did not. Clinicians using fMRI to guide surgical margins 
do not typically map known language-critical areas beyond Broca's and 
Wernicke's. This initial data shows many clinical teams are confident using fMRI 
not only for language lateralization but also to guide surgical margins. 
Reported cases of unexpected language preservation when fMRI activation is 
resected, and cases of language decline when it is not, emphasize a critical 
need for further validation. Comprehensive studies comparing commonly-used fMRI 
paradigms to predict stimulation mapping and post-surgical language decline 
remain of high importance.

BACKGROUND: Clinically approved antidepressants modulate the brain's emotional 
valence circuits, suggesting that the response of these circuits could serve as 
a biomarker for screening candidate antidepressant drugs. However, it is 
necessary that these modulations can be reliably detected. Here, we apply a 
cross-validated predictive model to classify emotional valence and pharmacologic 
effect across eleven task-based fMRI datasets (n = 306) exploring the effect of 
antidepressant administration on emotional face processing.
METHODS: We created subject-level contrast of parameter estimates of the 
emotional faces task and used the Shen whole-brain parcellation scheme to define 
268 subject-level features that trained a cross-validated gradient-boosting 
machine protocol to classify emotional valence (fearful vs happy face visual 
conditions) and pharmacologic effect (drug vs placebo administration) within and 
across studies.
RESULTS: We found patterns of brain activity that classify emotional valence 
with a statistically significant level of accuracy (70% across-all-subjects; 
range from 50 to 87% across-study). Our classifier failed to consistently 
discriminate drug from placebo. Subject population (healthy or unhealthy), 
treatment group (drug or placebo), and drug administration protocol (dose and 
duration) affected this accuracy with similar populations better predicting one 
another.
CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence that antidepressants modulated brain 
response in a consistent manner, however found a consistent signature for 
emotional valence. Variable functional patterns across studies suggest that 
predictive modeling can inform biomarker development in mental health and in 
pharmacotherapy development. Our results suggest that case-controlled designs 
and more standardized protocols are required for functional imaging to provide 
robust biomarkers for drug development.

INTRODUCTION: In this study, the authors seek to clarify the neurological 
changes before and after whole vault cranioplasty (WVC) in patients born with 
sagittal craniosynostosis.
METHODS: A case control study design was performed that included thirty 
functional MRI scans, from 25 individual patients. Functional MRI and diffusion 
tension imaging data were analyzed with BioImageSuite (Yale University, USA). 9 
functional brain networks were analyzed, with appropriate correlated functional 
regions of the brain and utilized for analysis.
RESULTS: Comparing functional MRI the infants after WVC versus infants before 
WVC group, the after WVC group demonstrated an increased connectivity in the 
left frontoparietal, secondary (V2), and third (V3) visual networks (P < 0.001). 
The right frontoparietal (RFPN) had decreased connectivity (P < 0.001). There is 
also a decrease and increase in anisotropy in the cingulum and precuneus despite 
surgery, respectively (P < 0.05). Adolescents treated with WVC compared to 
controls, demonstrated an increased connectivity in the salience and decreased 
connectivity in the RFPN relative to adolescent controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients born with sagittal craniosynostosis have different 
connections in infancy in most of the defined cerebral networks compared to 
controls. After surgery, there are specific connectivity changes that occur in 
the RFPN, left frontoparietal, V2, and V3 networks, which are areas associated 
with executive function and emotional control. Changes identified in white 
matter tract microstructure connections could be influential in changes in 
functional connectivity. Although, as a child with sagittal craniosynostosis 
develops, much of the abnormal network connections, seen in infancy 
preoperatively, corrects to some degree after surgery. However, some aberrancies 
in the salience and RFPN networks remain potentially affecting executive 
functioning.

Best practices are currently being developed for the acquisition and processing 
of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging data used to estimate brain 
functional organization-or "functional connectivity." Standards have been 
proposed based on test-retest reliability, but open questions remain. These 
include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain reliability, the 
influence of increasing runs versus sessions, the spatial distribution of 
reliability, the reliability of multivariate methods, and, crucially, how 
reliability maps onto prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 
extensively sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically 
configured scanners) to assess test-retest reliability of whole-brain 
connectivity within the generalizability theory framework. We used Human 
Connectome Project data to replicate these analyses and relate reliability to 
behavioral prediction. Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor 
reliability averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions was 
more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest for subcortical 
connections and highest for within-network cortical connections. Multivariate 
reliability was greater than univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used 
to improve prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this 
distinction for functional connectivity. A comprehensive understanding of 
test-retest reliability, including its limitations, supports the development of 
best practices in the field.

We examine metonymy at psycho- and neurolinguistic levels, seeking to adjudicate 
between two possible processing implementations (one- vs. two-mechanism). We 
compare highly conventionalized systematic metonymy (producer-for-product: "All 
freshmen read O'Connell") to lesser-conventionalized circumstantial metonymy 
("[a waitress says to another:] 'Table 2 asked for more coffee."'). Whereas 
these two metonymy types differ in terms of contextual demands, they each reveal 
a similar dependency between the named and intended conceptual entities (e.g., 
Jackendoff, 1997; Nunberg, 1979, 1995). We reason that if each metonymy yields a 
distinct processing time course and substantially non-overlapping preferential 
localization pattern, it would not only support a two-mechanism view (one 
lexical, one pragmatic) but would suggest that conventionalization acts as a 
linguistic categorizer. By contrast, a similar behavior in time course and 
localization would support a one-mechanism view and the inference that 
conventionalization acts instead as a modulator of contextual felicitousness, 
and that differences in interpretation introduced by conventionalization are of 
degree, not of kind. Results from three paradigms: self-paced reading (SPR), 
event-related potentials (ERP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI), reveal the following: no main effect by condition (metonymy vs. matched 
literal control) for either metonymy type immediately after the metonymy 
trigger, and a main effect for only the Circumstantial metonymy one word 
post-trigger (SPR); a N400 effect across metonymy types and a late positivity 
for Circumstantial metonymy (ERP); and a highly overlapping activation 
connecting the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Altogether, the pattern observed does not reach the 
threshold required to justify a two-mechanism system. Instead, the pattern is 
more naturally (and conservatively) understood as resulting from the 
implementation of a generalized referential dependency mechanism, modulated by 
degree of context dependence/conventionalization, thus supporting architectures 
of language whereby "lexical" and "pragmatic" meaning relations are encoded 
along a cline of contextual underspecification.

Preterm birth results in alterations in neural connectivity, but the impact of 
prematurity on the functional organization of the developing brain has yet to be 
explored. To test the hypothesis that preterm birth alters cortical organization 
during the late second and third trimesters of gestation, we interrogated 
cerebral lateralization at rest in 26 very preterm subjects (birth weight 
500-1500g) with no evidence of brain injury and 25 healthy term control subjects 
at term equivalent age. Employing an unbiased voxel-based measure of functional 
connectivity, these data demonstrated that cerebral lateralization is impaired 
in the prematurely-born. At term equivalent age, preterm neonates showed 
significantly less lateralization in regions subserving both receptive and 
expressive language, left Brodmann (BA) areas insula-BA22-BA21 and L BA45-BA47 
(p<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons for both). Exploratory region of 
interest analyses demonstrated significantly less inter-hemispheric connectivity 
from L BA22 to R BA22 in preterm infants compared to term controls (p<0.005) and 
from R BA22 to its homolog (p<0.005). L BA22, Wernicke's area, was more strongly 
connected to R BA39, foreshadowing neural networks for language in preterm 
subjects at school age, adolescence and young adulthood. For these very preterm 
neonates born at less than 30weeks' PMA, the degree of prematurity had no 
influence on lateralization in these differential regions.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used 
to study functional brain networks. Nevertheless, variability in these networks 
due to factors such as sex and aging is not fully understood. This study 
explored sex differences in normal age trajectories of resting-state networks 
(RSNs) using a novel voxel-wise measure of functional connectivity, the 
intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). Males and females showed differential 
patterns of changing connectivity in large-scale RSNs during normal aging from 
early adulthood to late middle-age. In some networks, such as the default-mode 
network, males and females both showed decreases in connectivity with age, 
albeit at different rates. In other networks, such as the fronto-parietal 
network, males and females showed divergent connectivity trajectories with age. 
Main effects of sex and age were found in many of the same regions showing 
sex-related differences in aging. Finally, these sex differences in aging 
trajectories were robust to choice of preprocessing strategy, such as global 
signal regression. Our findings resolve some discrepancies in the literature, 
especially with respect to the trajectory of connectivity in the default mode, 
which can be explained by our observed interactions between sex and aging. 
Overall, results indicate that RSNs show different aging trajectories for males 
and females. Characterizing effects of sex and age on RSNs are critical first 
steps in understanding the functional organization of the human brain.

BACKGROUND: Similarities between behavioral and substance addictions exist. 
However, direct neurobiological comparison between addictive disorders is rare. 
Determination of disorder-specificity (or lack thereof) of alterations within 
white-matter microstructures will advance understanding of the pathophysiology 
of addictions.
METHODS: We compared white-matter microstructural features between individuals 
with gambling disorder (GD; n=38), cocaine-use disorder (CUD; n=38) and healthy 
comparison (HC; n=38) participants, as assessed using diffusion-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). To provide a more precise estimate of 
diffusion within regions of complex architecture (e.g., cortico-limbic tracts), 
analyses were conducted using a crossing-fiber model incorporating 
local-orientation modeling (tbss_x). Anisotropy estimates for primary and 
secondary fiber orientations were compared using ANOVAs corrected for multiple 
comparisons across space using threshold-free cluster enhancement (pFWE<.05).
RESULTS: A main effect of group on anisotropy of secondary fiber orientations 
within the left internal capsule, corona radiata, forceps major and posterior 
thalamic radiation, involving reduced anisotropy among GD and CUD participants 
in comparison to HC participants. No differences in anisotropy measures were 
found between GD and CUD individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to compare diffusion indices directly 
between behavioral and substance addictions and the largest dMRI study of GD. 
Our findings indicate similar white-matter microstructural alterations across 
addictions that cannot be attributed solely to exposure to drugs or alcohol and 
thus may be a vulnerability mechanism for addictive disorders.

Neurosurgery, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

PURPOSE: Nonlinear gradient encoding methods, such as O-Space imaging, have been 
shown to provide good images from very few echoes. Acquiring data in a train of 
spin or gradient echoes is a very flexible way to further speed acquisition 
time. However, combining these strategies presents significant challenges, both 
in terms of the contrast and artifacts. We present strategies in both pulse 
sequence design and image processing to mitigate these effects.
THEORY AND METHODS: The three strategies include a new echo ordering that takes 
into account the unique way that O-Space samples the k-space of the image; a new 
postprocessing filter that allows tuning of T2-weighting by emphasizing the 
contribution of low frequency spatial information at selectable points in space 
and time; and an offset between linear and nonlinear gradients that makes the 
central point of each echo unique.
RESULTS: Simulations indicate that these strategies mitigate artifacts 
introduced by T2 (or T2*) decay and produce contrast that reflects relaxation at 
a given echo time.
CONCLUSION: Turbo spin echo O-Space is theoretically feasible, and the greater 
undersampling should make it possible to use shorter echo trains for a given 
scan time.

Increased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption has been linked to higher rates 
of obesity. Using functional MRI, we assessed brain perfusion responses to 
drinking two commonly consumed monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, in obese 
and lean adolescents. Marked differences were observed. In response to drinking 
glucose, obese adolescents exhibited decreased brain perfusion in brain regions 
involved in executive function (prefrontal cortex [PFC]) and increased perfusion 
in homeostatic appetite regions of the brain (hypothalamus). Conversely, in 
response to drinking glucose, lean adolescents demonstrated increased PFC brain 
perfusion and no change in perfusion in the hypothalamus. In addition, obese 
adolescents demonstrated attenuated suppression of serum acyl-ghrelin and 
increased circulating insulin level after glucose ingestion; furthermore, the 
change in acyl-ghrelin and insulin levels after both glucose and fructose 
ingestion was associated with increased hypothalamic, thalamic, and hippocampal 
blood flow in obese relative to lean adolescents. Additionally, in all subjects 
there was greater perfusion in the ventral striatum with fructose relative to 
glucose ingestion. Finally, reduced connectivity between executive, homeostatic, 
and hedonic brain regions was observed in obese adolescents. These data 
demonstrate that obese adolescents have impaired prefrontal executive control 
responses to drinking glucose and fructose, while their homeostatic and hedonic 
responses appear to be heightened. Thus, obesity-related brain adaptations to 
glucose and fructose consumption in obese adolescents may contribute to 
excessive consumption of glucose and fructose, thereby promoting further weight 
gain.

BACKGROUND: Preterm (PT) children show early cognitive and language deficits and 
display altered cortical connectivity for language compared to term (T) 
children. Developmentally, functional connectivity networks become more 
segregated and integrated, through the weakening of short-range and 
strengthening of long-range connections.
METHODS: Longitudinal intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD) values were 
assessed in PT (n = 13) compared to T children (n = 12) at ages 8 vs. 16 using a 
Linear Mixed Effects model. Connectivity values in regions generated by the 
group × age interaction analysis were then correlated to scores on full IQ 
(FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), verbal comprehension IQ (VCIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), 
Peabody picture vocabulary test-revised (PPVT-R), and Rapid Naming Composite 
(RDRL_Cmp).
RESULTS: Nine regions were generated by the group × age interaction analysis. PT 
connectivity significantly increased over time in all but two regions, and they 
ultimately displayed greater relative connectivity at age 16 than Ts in all 
areas except the left occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). PTs underwent significant 
connectivity reductions in the left OTC, which corresponded with worse 
performance on FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ. These findings differed from Ts, who did not 
undergo any significant changes in connectivity over time.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the developmental alterations in 
connectivity in PT children at adolescence are both pervasive and widespread. 
The persistent and worsening cognitive and language deficits noted in the PT 
subjects may be attributed to the loss of connections in the left OTC.

PURPOSE: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a powerful imaging technique that has 
led to improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral lesions and 
neurosurgical guidance for tumor resection. Traditional tensor modeling, 
however, has difficulties in differentiating tumor-infiltrated regions and 
peritumoral edema. Here, we describe the supertoroidal model, which incorporates 
an increase in surface genus and a continuum of toroidal shapes to improve upon 
the characterization of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI brain datasets of 18 individuals with GBM and 18 
normal subjects were acquired using a 3T scanner. A supertoroidal model of the 
diffusion tensor and two new diffusion tensor invariants, one to evaluate 
diffusivity, the toroidal volume (TV), and one to evaluate anisotropy, the 
toroidal curvature (TC), were applied and evaluated in the characterization of 
GBM brain tumors. TV and TC were compared with the mean diffusivity (MD) and 
fractional anisotropy (FA) indices inside the tumor, surrounding edema, as well 
as contralateral to the lesions, in the white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM).
RESULTS: The supertoroidal model enhanced the borders between tumors and 
surrounding structures, refined the boundaries between WM and GM, and revealed 
the heterogeneity inherent to tumor-infiltrated tissue. Both MD and TV 
demonstrated high intensities in the tumor, with lower values in the surrounding 
edema, which in turn were higher than those of unaffected brain parenchyma. Both 
TC and FA were effective in revealing the structural degradation of WM tracts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the supertoroidal model enables 
effective tensor visualization as well as quantitative scalar maps that improve 
the understanding of the underlying tissue structure properties. Hence, this 
approach has the potential to enhance diagnosis, preoperative planning, and 
intraoperative image guidance during surgical management of brain lesions.

Loving kindness is a form of meditation involving directed well-wishing, 
typically supported by the silent repetition of phrases such as "may all beings 
be happy," to foster a feeling of selfless love. Here we used functional 
magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neural substrate of loving kindness 
meditation in experienced meditators and novices. We first assessed group 
differences in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during loving kindness 
meditation. We next used a relatively novel approach, the intrinsic connectivity 
distribution of functional connectivity, to identify regions that differ in 
intrinsic connectivity between groups, and then used a data-driven approach to 
seed-based connectivity analysis to identify which connections differ between 
groups. Our findings suggest group differences in brain regions involved in 
self-related processing and mind wandering, emotional processing, inner speech, 
and memory. Meditators showed overall reduced BOLD signal and intrinsic 
connectivity during loving kindness as compared to novices, more specifically in 
the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), a finding that is consistent 
with our prior work and other recent neuroimaging studies of meditation. 
Furthermore, meditators showed greater functional connectivity during loving 
kindness between the PCC/PCu and the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas 
novices showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between 
the PCC/PCu and other cortical midline regions of the default mode network, the 
bilateral posterior insula lobe, and the bilateral parahippocampus/hippocampus. 
These novel findings suggest that loving kindness meditation involves a 
present-centered, selfless focus for meditators as compared to novices.

We employed brain-behavior analyses to explore the relationship between 
performance on tasks measuring phonological awareness, pseudoword decoding, and 
rapid auditory processing (all predictors of reading (dis)ability) and brain 
organization for print and speech in beginning readers. For print-related 
activation, we observed a shared set of skill-correlated regions, including left 
hemisphere temporoparietal and occipitotemporal sites, as well as inferior 
frontal, visual, visual attention, and subcortical components. For 
speech-related activation, shared variance among reading skill measures was most 
prominently correlated with activation in left hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus 
and precuneus. Implications for brain-based models of literacy acquisition are 
discussed.

Patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often demonstrate impaired 
interictal attention, even with control of their seizures. No previous study has 
investigated the brain networks involved in this impairment. We used the 
continuous performance task (CPT) of attentional vigilance and the repetitive 
tapping task (RTT), a control motor task, to examine interictal attention in 26 
children with CAE and 22 matched healthy controls. Each subject underwent 
simultaneous 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging-electroencephalography 
(fMRI-EEG) and CPT/RTT testing. Areas of activation on fMRI during the CPT task 
were correlated with behavioral performance and used as seed regions for resting 
functional connectivity analysis. All behavioral measures reflecting inattention 
were significantly higher in patients. Correlation analysis revealed that 
impairment on all measures of inattention on the CPT task was associated with 
decreased medial frontal cortex (MFC) activation during CPT. In addition, 
analysis of resting functional connectivity revealed an overall decrease within 
an 'attention network' in patients relative to controls. Patients demonstrated 
significantly impaired connectivity between the right anterior insula/frontal 
operculum (In/FO) and MFC relative to controls. Our results suggest that there 
is impaired function in an attention network comprising anterior In/FO and MFC 
in patients with CAE. These findings provide an anatomical and functional basis 
for impaired interictal attention in CAE, which may allow the development of 
improved treatments targeted at these networks.

Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM; Finn et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2017) 
was recently developed to predict individual differences in traits and 
behaviors, including fluid intelligence (Finn et al., 2015) and sustained 
attention (Rosenberg et al., 2016a), from functional brain connectivity (FC) 
measured with fMRI. Here, using the CPM framework, we compared the predictive 
power of three different measures of FC (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and 
discordance) and two different prediction algorithms (linear and partial least 
square [PLS] regression) for attention function. Accordance and discordance are 
recently proposed FC measures that respectively track in-phase synchronization 
and out-of-phase anti-correlation (Meskaldji et al., 2015). We defined 
connectome-based models using task-based or resting-state FC data, and tested 
the effects of (1) functional connectivity measure and (2) 
feature-selection/prediction algorithm on individualized attention predictions. 
Models were internally validated in a training dataset using 
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and externally validated with three 
independent datasets. The training dataset included fMRI data collected while 
participants performed a sustained attention task and rested (N = 25; Rosenberg 
et al., 2016a). The validation datasets included: 1) data collected during 
performance of a stop-signal task and at rest (N = 83, including 19 participants 
who were administered methylphenidate prior to scanning; Farr et al., 2014a; 
Rosenberg et al., 2016b), 2) data collected during Attention Network Task 
performance and rest (N = 41, Rosenberg et al., in press), and 3) resting-state 
data and ADHD symptom severity from the ADHD-200 Consortium (N = 113; Rosenberg 
et al., 2016a). Models defined using all combinations of functional connectivity 
measure (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and prediction 
algorithm (linear and PLS regression) predicted attentional abilities, with 
correlations between predicted and observed measures of attention as high as 0.9 
for internal validation, and 0.6 for external validation (all p's < 0.05). 
Models trained on task data outperformed models trained on rest data. Pearson's 
correlation and accordance features generally showed a small numerical advantage 
over discordance features, while PLS regression models were usually better than 
linear regression models. Overall, in addition to correlation features combined 
with linear models (Rosenberg et al., 2016a), it is useful to consider 
accordance features and PLS regression for CPM.

IMPORTANCE: Alcohol dependence is a chronic relapsing illness; stress, 
alcohol-related cues, and neutral-relaxing states significantly influence 
craving and relapse risk. However, neural mechanisms underlying the association 
between these states and alcohol craving and relapse risk remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To identify neural correlates associated with alcohol craving and 
relapse outcomes in 45 treatment-engaged, 4- to 8-week abstinent 
alcohol-dependent (AD) patients, and to compare brain responses of 30 
demographically matched AD patients and 30 healthy control subjects during 
stress, alcohol, and neutral-relaxing cues.
DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging study while participants were 
engaging in brief individualized script-driven imagery trials of stress, alcohol 
cues, and neutral-relaxing scenarios, and a prospective clinical outcome design 
to assess alcohol relapse 90 days postdischarge from inpatient treatment in the 
AD group.
SETTINGS: Inpatient treatment setting in a community mental health center and 
hospital-based research unit.
PATIENTS: Forty-five recovering AD patients in inpatient treatment for examining 
relapse, and 30 healthy control subjects demographically matched to 30 AD 
patients (subgroup of the relapse sample) for group comparisons.
INTERVENTION: Twelve-step recovery-based addiction treatment for the patient 
group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain response, alcohol craving, and relapse outcome 
measures (time to relapse and relapse severity).
RESULTS: Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC) activation during neutral-relaxing trials was correlated with high 
alcohol cue-induced and stress-induced craving in early recovering AD patients 
(x = 6, y = 43, z = -6; P < .01, whole-brain corrected). This vmPFC/ACC 
hyperactivity significantly predicted subsequent alcohol relapse, with a hazards 
ratio greater than 8 for increased relapse risk. Additionally, vmPFC/ACC 
hyperactivation during neutral trials and reduced activity during stress trials 
were each predictive of greater days of alcohol used after relapse (P < .01, 
whole-brain corrected). In contrast, matched control subjects showed the reverse 
pattern of vmPFC/ACC responses to stress, alcohol cues, and relaxed trials 
(F = 6.42; P < .01, whole-brain corrected).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings indicate that disrupted vmPFC/ACC function 
plays a role in jeopardizing recovery from alcoholism and may serve as a neural 
marker to identify those at risk for alcohol relapse.

In the sentence "The captain who the sailor greeted is tall," the connection 
between the relative pronoun and the object position of greeted represents a 
long-distance dependency (LDD), necessary for the interpretation of "the 
captain" as the individual being greeted. Whereas the lesion-based record shows 
preferential involvement of only the left inferior frontal (LIF) cortex, 
associated with Broca's aphasia, during real-time comprehension of LDDs, the 
neuroimaging record shows additional involvement of the left posterior superior 
temporal (LPST) and lower parietal cortices, which are associated with 
Wernicke's aphasia. We test the hypothesis that this localization incongruence 
emerges from an interaction of memory and linguistic constraints involved in the 
real-time implementation of these dependencies and which had not been previously 
isolated. Capitalizing on a long-standing psycholinguistic understanding of LDDs 
as the workings of an active filler, we distinguish two linguistically defined 
mechanisms: GAP-search, triggered by the retrieval of the relative pronoun, and 
GAP-completion, triggered by the retrieval of the embedded verb. Each mechanism 
is hypothesized to have distinct memory demands and given their distinct 
linguistic import, potentially distinct brain correlates. Using fMRI, we isolate 
the two mechanisms by analyzing their relevant sentential segments as separate 
events. We manipulate LDD-presence/absence and GAP-search type (direct/indirect) 
reflecting the absence/presence of intervening islands. Results show a direct 
GAP-search-LIF cortex correlation that crucially excludes the LPST cortex. 
Notably, indirect GAP-search recruitment is confined to supplementary-motor and 
lower-parietal cortex indicating that GAP presence alone is not enough to engage 
predictive functions in the LIF cortex. Finally, GAP-completion shows 
recruitment implicating the dorsal pathway including: the supplementary motor 
cortex, left supramarginal cortex, precuneus, and anterior/dorsal cingulate. 
Altogether, the results are consistent with previous findings connecting 
GAP-search, as we define it, to the LIF cortex. They are not consistent with an 
involvement of the LPST cortex in any of the two mechanisms, and therefore 
support the view that the LPST cortex is not crucial to LDD implementation. 
Finally, results support neurocognitive architectures that involve the dorsal 
pathway in LDD resolution and that distinguish the memory commitments of the LIF 
cortex as sensitive to specific language-dependent constraints beyond 
phrase-structure building considerations.

Multisite neuroimaging studies can facilitate the investigation of brain-related 
changes in many contexts, including patient groups that are relatively rare in 
the general population. Though multisite studies have characterized the 
reliability of brain activation during working memory and motor functional 
magnetic resonance imaging tasks, emotion processing tasks, pertinent to many 
clinical populations, remain less explored. A traveling participants study was 
conducted with eight healthy volunteers scanned twice on consecutive days at 
each of the eight North American Longitudinal Prodrome Study sites. Tests 
derived from generalizability theory showed excellent reliability in the 
amygdala ( Eρ2 = 0.82), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; Eρ2 = 0.83), anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC; Eρ2 = 0.76), insula ( Eρ2 = 0.85), and fusiform gyrus ( 
Eρ2 = 0.91) for maximum activation and fair to excellent reliability in the 
amygdala ( Eρ2 = 0.44), IFG ( Eρ2 = 0.48), ACC ( Eρ2 = 0.55), insula ( Eρ2 = 
0.42), and fusiform gyrus ( Eρ2 = 0.83) for mean activation across sites and 
test days. For the amygdala, habituation ( Eρ2 = 0.71) was more stable than mean 
activation. In a second investigation, data from 111 healthy individuals across 
sites were aggregated in a voxelwise, quantitative meta-analysis. When compared 
with a mixed effects model controlling for site, both approaches identified 
robust activation in regions consistent with expected results based on prior 
single-site research. Overall, regions central to emotion processing showed 
strong reliability in the traveling participants study and robust activation in 
the aggregation study. These results support the reliability of blood oxygen 
level-dependent signal in emotion processing areas across different sites and 
scanners and may inform future efforts to increase efficiency and enhance 
knowledge of rare conditions in the population through multisite neuroimaging 
paradigms.

OBJECTIVE: To examine age-related changes in the neural systems for reading in 
nonimpaired and dyslexic children and adolescents.
METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study age-related 
changes in the neural systems for reading in a cross-sectional sample of 232 
right-handed children 7 to 18 years of age (113 dyslexic readers and 119 
nonimpaired readers) as they read pseudowords.
RESULTS: In nonimpaired readers, systems in the left anterior lateral 
occipitotemporal area developed with age, whereas systems in the right superior 
and middle frontal regions decreased. In contrast, in dyslexic readers, systems 
in the left posterior medial occipitotemporal regions developed with age. Older 
nonimpaired readers were left lateralized in the anterior lateral 
occipitotemporal area; there was no difference in asymmetry between younger and 
older dyslexic readers.
INTERPRETATION: These findings offer a possible neurobiological explanation for 
the differences in reading acquisition between dyslexic and nonimpaired readers 
and provide further evidence of the critical role of the left occipitotemporal 
region in the development of reading.

Meditation has been associated with relatively reduced activity in the default 
mode network, a brain network implicated in self-related thinking and mind 
wandering. However, previous imaging studies have typically compared meditation 
to rest, despite other studies having reported differences in brain activation 
patterns between meditators and controls at rest. Moreover, rest is associated 
with a range of brain activation patterns across individuals that has only 
recently begun to be better characterized. Therefore, in this study we compared 
meditation to another active cognitive task, both to replicate the findings that 
meditation is associated with relatively reduced default mode network activity 
and to extend these findings by testing whether default mode activity was 
reduced during meditation, beyond the typical reductions observed during 
effortful tasks. In addition, prior studies had used small groups, whereas in 
the present study we tested these hypotheses in a larger group. The results 
indicated that meditation is associated with reduced activations in the default 
mode network, relative to an active task, for meditators as compared to 
controls. Regions of the default mode network showing a Group × Task interaction 
included the posterior cingulate/precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex. These 
findings replicate and extend prior work indicating that the suppression of 
default mode processing may represent a central neural process in long-term 
meditation, and they suggest that meditation leads to relatively reduced default 
mode processing beyond that observed during another active cognitive task.

Preterm (PT) subjects are at risk for developmental delay, and task-based 
studies suggest that developmental disorders may be due to alterations in neural 
connectivity. Since emerging data imply the importance of right cerebellar 
function for language acquisition in typical development, we hypothesized that 
PT subjects would have alternate areas of cerebellar connectivity, and that 
these areas would be responsible for differences in cognitive outcomes between 
PT subjects and term controls at age 20 years. Nineteen PT and 19 term control 
young adults were prospectively studied using resting-state functional MRI 
(fMRI) to create voxel-based contrast maps reflecting the functional 
connectivity of each tissue element in the grey matter through analysis of the 
intrinsic connectivity contrast degree (ICC-d). Left cerebellar ICC-d 
differences between subjects identified a region of interest that was used for 
subsequent seed-based connectivity analyses. Subjects underwent standardized 
language testing, and correlations with cognitive outcomes were assessed. There 
were no differences in gender, hand preference, maternal education, age at 
study, or Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores. Functional connectivity 
(FcMRI) demonstrated increased tissue connectivity in the biventer, simple and 
quadrangular lobules of the L cerebellum (p<0.05) in PTs compared to term 
controls; seed-based analyses from these regions demonstrated alterations in 
connectivity from L cerebellum to both R and L inferior frontal gyri (IFG) in 
PTs compared to term controls. For PTs but not term controls, there were 
significant positive correlations between these connections and PPVT scores (R 
IFG: r=0.555, p=0.01; L IFG: r=0.454, p=0.05), as well as Verbal Comprehension 
Index (VCI) scores (R IFG: r=0.472, p=0.04). These data suggest the presence of 
a left cerebellar language circuit in PT subjects at young adulthood. These 
findings may represent either a delay in maturation or the engagement of 
alternative neural pathways for language in the developing PT brain.

This magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrates increased lateral ventricle 
volume (LVV) in adolescents and adults with bipolar disorder (BD) with psychotic 
symptoms, but not without psychosis, compared to healthy adolescents and adults. 
This suggests LVV is a morphologic feature associated with psychosis in BD, 
present by adolescence.

Sequences that encode the spatial information of an object using nonlinear 
gradient fields are a new frontier in MRI, with potential to provide lower 
peripheral nerve stimulation, windowed fields of view, tailored 
spatially-varying resolution, curved slices that mirror physiological geometry, 
and, most importantly, very fast parallel imaging with multichannel coils. The 
acceleration for multichannel images is generally explained by the fact that 
curvilinear gradient isocontours better complement the azimuthal spatial 
encoding provided by typical receiver arrays. However, the details of this 
complementarity have been more difficult to specify. We present a simple and 
intuitive framework for describing the mechanics of image formation with 
nonlinear gradients, and we use this framework to review some the main classes 
of nonlinear encoding schemes.

Age-related variations in resting state connectivity of the human brain were 
examined from young adulthood through middle age. A voxel-based network measure, 
degree, was used to assess age-related differences in tissue connectivity 
throughout the brain. Increases in connectivity with age were found in 
paralimbic cortical and subcortical regions. Decreases in connectivity were 
found in cortical regions, including visual areas and the default mode network. 
These findings differ from those of recent developmental studies examining 
earlier growth trajectories, and are consistent with known changes in cognitive 
function and emotional processing during mature aging. The results support and 
extend previous findings that relied on a priori definitions of regions of 
interest for their analyses. This approach of applying a voxel-based measure to 
examine the functional connectivity of individual tissue elements over time, 
without the need for a priori region of interest definitions, provides an 
important new tool in brain science.

Several brain areas show signal decreases during many different cognitive tasks 
in functional imaging studies, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) 
and a medial frontal region incorporating portions of the medial frontal gyrus 
and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (MFG/vACC). It has been suggested that 
these areas are components in a default mode network that is engaged during rest 
and disengaged during cognitive tasks. This study investigated the functional 
connectivity between the PCC and MFG/vACC during a working memory task and at 
rest by examining temporal correlations in magnetic resonance signal levels 
between the regions. The two regions were functionally connected in both 
conditions. In addition, performance on the working memory task was positively 
correlated with the strength of this functional connection not only during the 
working memory task, but also at rest. Thus, it appears these regions are 
components of a network that may facilitate or monitor cognitive performance, 
rather than becoming disengaged during cognitive tasks. In addition, these data 
raise the possibility that the individual differences in coupling strength 
between these two regions at rest predict differences in cognitive abilities 
important for this working memory task.

PURPOSE: To explore (i) the variability of upper cervical cord area (UCCA) 
measurements from volumetric brain 3D T1 -weighted scans related to gradient 
nonlinearity (GNL) and subject positioning; (ii) the effect of 
vendor-implemented GNL corrections; and (iii) easily applicable methods that can 
be used to retrospectively correct data.
METHODS: A multiple sclerosis patient was scanned at seven sites using 3T MRI 
scanners with the same 3D T1 -weighted protocol without GNL-distortion 
correction. Two healthy subjects and a phantom were additionally scanned at a 
single site with varying table positions. The 2D and 3D vendor-implemented 
GNL-correction algorithms and retrospective methods based on (i) phantom data 
fit, (ii) normalization with C2 vertebral body diameters, and (iii) the Jacobian 
determinant of nonlinear registrations to a template were tested.
RESULTS: Depending on the positioning of the subject, GNL introduced up to 15% 
variability in UCCA measurements from volumetric brain T1 -weighted scans when 
no distortion corrections were used. The 3D vendor-implemented correction 
methods and the three proposed methods reduced this variability to less than 3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results raise awareness of the significant impact that GNL can 
have on quantitative UCCA studies, and point the way to prospectively and 
retrospectively managing GNL distortions in a variety of settings, including 
clinical environments. Magn Reson Med 79:1595-1601, 2018. © 2017 International

Fluctuations in Global Brain Activity Are Associated With Changes in Whole-Brain 
Connectivity of Functional Networks.

Scheinost D, Tokoglu F, Shen X, Finn ES, Noble S, Papademetris X, Constable RT.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between global 
brain activity, changes in whole-brain connectivity, and changes in brain states 
across subjects using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: We extended current methods that use a sparse set of coactivation 
patterns to extract critical time points in global brain activity. Critical 
activity time points were defined as points where the global signal is greater 
than one standard deviation above or below the average global signal. Four 
categories of critical points were defined along dimensions of global signal 
intensity and trajectory. Voxel-based methods were used to interrogate 
differences in connectivity between these critical points.
RESULTS: Several differences in connectivity were found in functional 
resting-state networks (RSNs) as a function of global activity. RSNs associated 
with cognitive functions in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions exhibited 
greater whole-brain connectivity during lower global activity states. Meanwhile, 
RSNs associated with sensory functions exhibited greater whole-brain 
connectivity during the higher global activity states. Moreover, we present 
evidence that these results depend in part upon the standard deviation threshold 
used to define the critical points, suggesting critical points at different 
thresholds represent unique brain states.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that the brain 
oscillates through different states over the course of a resting-state study 
reflecting differences in RSN connectivity associated with global brain 
activity.
SIGNIFICANCE: Increased understanding of brain dynamics may help to elucidate 
individual differences in behavior and dysfunction.

While the Talairach atlas remains the most commonly used system for reporting 
coordinates in neuroimaging studies, the absence of an actual 3-D image of the 
original brain used in its construction has severely limited the ability of 
researchers to automatically map locations from 3-D anatomical MRI images to the 
atlas. Previous work in this area attempted to circumvent this problem by 
constructing approximate linear and piecewise-linear mappings between standard 
brain templates (e.g. the MNI template) and Talairach space. These methods are 
limited in that they can only account for differences in overall brain size and 
orientation but cannot correct for the actual shape differences between the MNI 
template and the Talairach brain. In this paper we describe our work to digitize 
the Talairach atlas and generate a non-linear mapping between the Talairach 
atlas and the MNI template that attempts to compensate for the actual 
differences in shape between the two, resulting in more accurate coordinate 
transformations. We present examples in this paper and note that the method is 
available freely online as a Java applet.

This study investigates how syntactic and semantic load factors impact sentence 
comprehension and BOLD signal under moderate hypoglycemia. A dual session, whole 
brain fMRI study was conducted on 16 healthy participants using the glucose 
clamp technique. In one session, they experienced insulin-induced hypoglycemia 
(plasma glucose at ∼50mg/dL); in the other, plasma glucose was maintained at 
euglycemic levels (∼100mg/dL). During scans subjects were presented with 
sentences of contrasting syntactic (embedding vs. conjunction) and semantic 
(reversibility vs. irreversibility) load. Semantic factors dominated the overall 
load effects on both performance (p<0.001) and BOLD response (p<0.01, 
corrected). Differential BOLD signal was observed in frontal, temporal, 
temporo-parietal and medio-temporal regions. Hypoglycemia and syntactic factors 
significantly impacted performance (p=0.002) and BOLD response (p<0.01, 
corrected) in the reversible clause conditions, more extensively in 
reversible-embedded than in reversible-conjoined clauses. Hypoglycemia resulted 
in a robust decrease in performance on reversible clauses and exerted 
attenuating effects on BOLD unselectively across cortical circuits. The 
dominance of reversibility in all measures underscores the distinction between 
the syntactic and semantic contrasts. The syntactic is based in a quantitative 
difference in algorithms interpreting embedded and conjoined structures. We 
suggest that the semantic is based in a qualitative difference between 
algorithmic mapping of arguments in reversible clauses and heuristic linking in 
irreversible clauses. Because heuristics drastically reduce resource demand, the 
operations they support would resist the load-dependent cognitive consequences 
of hypoglycemia.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco-use disorder is a complex condition involving multiple 
brain networks and presenting with multiple behavioral correlates including 
changes in diet and stress. In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) study of neural responses to favorite-food, stress, and neutral-relaxing 
imagery, smokers versus nonsmokers demonstrated blunted corticostriatal-limbic 
responses to favorite-food cues. Based on other recent reports of alterations in 
functional brain networks in smokers, the current study examined functional 
connectivity during exposure to favorite-food, stress, and neutral-relaxing 
imagery in smokers and nonsmokers, using the same dataset.
METHODS: The intrinsic connectivity distribution was measured to identify brain 
regions that differed in degree of functional connectivity between groups during 
each imagery condition. Resulting clusters were evaluated for seed-to-voxel 
connectivity to identify the specific connections that differed between groups 
during each imagery condition.
RESULTS: During exposure to favorite-food imagery, smokers versus nonsmokers 
showed lower connectivity in the supramarginal gyrus, and differences in 
connectivity between the supramarginal gyrus and the corticostriatal-limbic 
system. During exposure to neutral-relaxing imagery, smokers versus nonsmokers 
showed greater connectivity in the precuneus, and greater connectivity between 
the precuneus and the posterior insula and rolandic operculum. During exposure 
to stress imagery, smokers versus nonsmokers showed lower connectivity in the 
cerebellum.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide data-driven insights into smoking-related 
alterations in brain functional connectivity patterns related to appetitive, 
relaxing, and stressful states.
IMPLICATIONS: This study uses a data-driven approach to demonstrate that smokers 
and nonsmokers show differential patterns of functional connectivity during 
guided imagery related to personalized favorite-food, stress, and 
neutral-relaxing cues, in brain regions implicated in attention, reward-related, 
emotional, and motivational processes. For smokers, these differences in 
connectivity may impact appetite, stress, and relaxation, and may interfere with 
smoking cessation.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate functional connectivity 
(FC) changes in epileptogenic networks in intractable partial epilepsy obtained 
from resting-state fMRI by using intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC), a 
voxel-based network measure of degree that reflects the number of connections to 
each voxel.
METHODS: We measured differences between intrahemispheric- and 
interhemispheric-ICC (ICCintra-inter) that could reveal localized connectivity 
abnormalities in epileptogenic zones while more global network changes would be 
eliminated when subtracting these values. The ICCintra-inter map was compared 
with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) based on intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings 
in 29 patients with at least 1 year of postsurgical follow-up. Two independent 
reviewers blindly interpreted the icEEG and fMRI data, and the concordance rates 
were compared for various clinical factors.
RESULTS: Concordance between the icEEG SOZ and ICCintra-inter map was observed 
in 72.4% (21/29) of the patients, which was higher in patients with good 
surgical outcome, especially in those patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) 
or lateral temporal seizure localization. Concordance was also better in the 
extratemporal lobe epilepsy than the TLE group. In 85.7% (18/21) of the cases, 
the ICCintra-inter values were negative in the SOZ, indicating decreased FC 
within the epileptic hemisphere relative to between hemispheres.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing alterations in FC using fMRI-ICC map can help localize 
the SOZ, which has potential as a noninvasive presurgical diagnostic tool to 
improve surgical outcome. In addition, the method reveals that, in focal 
epilepsy, both intrahemispheric- and interhemispheric-FC may be altered, in the 
presence of both regional as well as global network abnormalities.

We present a novel method for controlling the effects of group differences in 
motion on functional connectivity studies. Resting-state functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a powerful tool that allows for the assessment of 
whole-brain functional organization across a wide range of clinical populations. 
However, as highlighted by recent studies, many measures commonly used in 
rs-fMRI are highly correlated with subject head movement. A source of this 
problem is that motion itself, and motion correction algorithms, lead to spatial 
smoothing, which is then variable across the brain and across subjects or groups 
dependent upon the amount of motion present during scanning. Studies aimed at 
elucidating differences between populations that have different head-motion 
characteristics (e.g., patients often move more in the scanner than healthy 
control subjects) are significantly confounded by these effects. In this work, 
we propose a solution to this problem, uniform smoothing, which ensures that all 
subject images in a study have equal effective spatial resolution. We establish 
that differences in the intrinsic smoothness of images across a group can 
confound connectivity results and link these differences in smoothness to 
motion. We demonstrate that eliminating these smoothness differences via our 
uniform smoothing solution is successful in reducing confounds related to the 
differences in head motion between subjects.

Recent advances in brain imaging have improved the measure of neural processes 
related to perceptual, cognitive and affective functions, yet the relation 
between brain activity and subjective experience remains poorly characterized. 
In part, it is a challenge to obtain reliable accounts of participant's 
experience in such studies. Here we addressed this limitation by utilizing 
experienced meditators who are expert in introspection. We tested a novel method 
to link objective and subjective data, using real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) to provide 
participants with feedback of their own brain activity during an ongoing task. 
We provided real-time feedback during a focused attention task from the 
posterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the default mode network shown to be 
activated during mind-wandering and deactivated during meditation. In a first 
experiment, both meditators and non-meditators reported significant 
correspondence between the feedback graph and their subjective experience of 
focused attention and mind-wandering. When instructed to volitionally decrease 
the feedback graph, meditators, but not non-meditators, showed significant 
deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex. We were able to replicate these 
results in a separate group of meditators using a novel step-wise rt-fMRI 
discovery protocol in which participants were not provided with prior knowledge 
of the expected relationship between their experience and the feedback graph 
(i.e., focused attention versus mind-wandering). These findings support the 
feasibility of using rt-fMRI to link objective measures of brain activity with 
reports of ongoing subjective experience in cognitive neuroscience research, and 
demonstrate the generalization of expertise in introspective awareness to novel 
contexts.

Real-time fMRI biofeedback targeting the orbitofrontal cortex for contamination 
anxiety.

We present a method for training subjects to control activity in a region of 
their orbitofrontal cortex associated with contamination anxiety using 
biofeedback of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) data. 
Increased activity of this region is seen in relationship with contamination 
anxiety both in control subjects and in individuals with obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), a relatively common and often debilitating psychiatric disorder 
involving contamination anxiety. Although many brain regions have been 
implicated in OCD, abnormality in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is one of the 
most consistent findings. Furthermore, hyperactivity in the OFC has been found 
to correlate with OCD symptom severity and decreases in hyperactivity in this 
region have been reported to correlate with decreased symptom severity. 
Therefore, the ability to control this brain area may translate into clinical 
improvements in obsessive-compulsive symptoms including contamination anxiety. 
Biofeedback of rt-fMRI data is a new technique in which the temporal pattern of 
activity in a specific region (or associated with a specific distributed pattern 
of brain activity) in a subject's brain is provided as a feedback signal to the 
subject. Recent reports indicate that people are able to develop control over 
the activity of specific brain areas when provided with rt-fMRI biofeedback. In 
particular, several studies using this technique to target brain areas involved 
in emotion processing have reported success in training subjects to control 
these regions. In several cases, rt-fMRI biofeedback training has been reported 
to induce cognitive, emotional, or clinical changes in subjects. Here we 
illustrate this technique as applied to the treatment of contamination anxiety 
in healthy subjects. This biofeedback intervention will be a valuable basic 
research tool: it allows researchers to perturb brain function, measure the 
resulting changes in brain dynamics and relate those to changes in contamination 
anxiety or other behavioral measures. In addition, the establishment of this 
method serves as a first step towards the investigation of fMRI-based 
biofeedback as a therapeutic intervention for OCD. Given that approximately a 
quarter of patients with OCD receive little benefit from the currently available 
forms of treatment, and that those who do benefit rarely recover completely, new 
approaches for treating this population are urgently needed.

Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry in 
41 healthy individuals, this study evaluated the association between the 
personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism, on the one hand, and 
individual differences in localized brain volume and gray matter concentration, 
on the other, with a special focus on the amygdala. Extraversion was positively 
correlated with gray matter concentration in the left amygdala, whereas 
neuroticism was negatively correlated with gray matter concentration in the 
right amygdala. Given that neuroticism is a risk factor for depression, our 
finding offers one explanation as to why prior structural imaging studies of 
depressed patients (which did not control for personality) produced conflicting 
findings. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the view that amygdala 
reduction seen in depressed patients precedes the onset of the disease, rather 
than being a consequence of the illness.

Using fMRI, we explored the relationship between phonological awareness (PA), a 
measure of metaphonological knowledge of the segmental structure of speech, and 
brain activation patterns during processing of print and speech in young readers 
from 6 to 10 years of age. Behavioral measures of PA were positively correlated 
with activation levels for print relative to speech tokens in superior temporal 
and occipito-temporal regions. Differences between print-elicited activation 
levels in superior temporal and inferior frontal sites were also correlated with 
PA measures with the direction of the correlation depending on stimulus type: 
positive for pronounceable pseudowords and negative for consonant strings. These 
results support and extend the many indications in the behavioral and 
neurocognitive literature that PA is a major component of skill in beginning 
readers and point to a developmental trajectory by which written language 
engages areas originally shaped by speech for learners on the path toward 
successful literacy acquisition.

BACKGROUND: Functional connectivity analyses of functional magnetic resonance 
imaging data are a powerful tool for characterizing brain networks and how they 
are disrupted in neural disorders. However, many such analyses examine only one 
or a small number of a priori seed regions. Studies that consider the whole 
brain frequently rely on anatomic atlases to define network nodes, which might 
result in mixing distinct activation time-courses within a single node. Here, we 
improve upon previous methods by using a data-driven brain parcellation to 
compare connectivity profiles of dyslexic (DYS) versus non-impaired (NI) readers 
in the first whole-brain functional connectivity analysis of dyslexia.
METHODS: Whole-brain connectivity was assessed in children (n = 75; 43 NI, 32 
DYS) and adult (n = 104; 64 NI, 40 DYS) readers.
RESULTS: Compared to NI readers, DYS readers showed divergent connectivity 
within the visual pathway and between visual association areas and prefrontal 
attention areas; increased right-hemisphere connectivity; reduced connectivity 
in the visual word-form area (part of the left fusiform gyrus specialized for 
printed words); and persistent connectivity to anterior language regions around 
the inferior frontal gyrus.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, findings suggest that NI readers are better able to 
integrate visual information and modulate their attention to visual stimuli, 
allowing them to recognize words on the basis of their visual properties, 
whereas DYS readers recruit altered reading circuits and rely on laborious 
phonology-based "sounding out" strategies into adulthood. These results deepen 
our understanding of the neural basis of dyslexia and highlight the importance 
of synchrony between diverse brain regions for successful reading.

Multisite longitudinal neuroimaging designs are used to identify differential 
brain structural change associated with onset or progression of disease. The 
reliability of neuroanatomical measurements over time and across sites is a 
crucial aspect of power in such studies. Prior work has found that while 
within-site reliabilities of neuroanatomical measurements are excellent, 
between-site reliability is generally more modest. Factors that may increase 
between-site reliability include standardization of scanner platform and 
sequence parameters and correction for between-scanner variations in gradient 
nonlinearities. Factors that may improve both between- and within-site 
reliability include use of registration algorithms that account for individual 
differences in cortical patterning and shape. In this study 8 healthy volunteers 
were scanned twice on successive days at 8 sites participating in the North 
American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS). All sites employed 3 Tesla 
scanners and standardized acquisition parameters. Site accounted for 2 to 30% of 
the total variance in neuroanatomical measurements. However, site-related 
variations were trivial (<1%) among sites using the same scanner model and 
12-channel coil or when correcting for between-scanner differences in gradient 
nonlinearity and scaling. Adjusting for individual differences in sulcal-gyral 
geometries yielded measurements with greater reliabilities than those obtained 
using an automated approach. Neuroimaging can be performed across multiple sites 
at the same level of reliability as at a single site, achieving within- and 
between-site reliabilities of 0.95 or greater for gray matter density in the 
majority of voxels in the prefrontal and temporal cortical surfaces as well as 
for the volumes of most subcortical structures.

PURPOSE: An iterative k-space trajectory and radiofrequency (RF) pulse design 
method is proposed for excitation using nonlinear gradient magnetic fields.
THEORY AND METHODS: The spatial encoding functions (SEFs) generated by nonlinear 
gradient fields are linearly dependent in Cartesian coordinates. Left 
uncorrected, this may lead to flip angle variations in excitation profiles. In 
the proposed method, SEFs (k-space samples) are selected using a matching 
pursuit algorithm, and the RF pulse is designed using a conjugate gradient 
algorithm. Three variants of the proposed approach are given: the full 
algorithm, a computationally cheaper version, and a third version for designing 
spoke-based trajectories. The method is demonstrated for various target 
excitation profiles using simulations and phantom experiments.
RESULTS: The method is compared with other iterative (matching pursuit and 
conjugate gradient) and noniterative (coordinate-transformation and 
Jacobian-based) pulse design methods as well as uniform density spiral and EPI 
trajectories. The results show that the proposed method can increase excitation 
fidelity.
CONCLUSION: An iterative method for designing k-space trajectories and RF pulses 
using nonlinear gradient fields is proposed. The method can either be used for 
selecting the SEFs individually to guide trajectory design, or can be adapted to 
design and optimize specific trajectories of interest.

This work examines the influence of changes in baseline activity on the 
intrinsic functional connectivity fMRI (fc-fMRI) in humans. Baseline brain 
activity was altered by inducing anesthesia (sevoflurane end-tidal concentration 
1%) in human volunteers and fc-fMRI maps between the pre-anesthetized and 
anesthetized conditions were compared across different brain networks. We 
particularly focused on low-level sensory areas (primary somatosensory, visual, 
and auditory cortices), the thalamus, and pain (insula), memory (hippocampus) 
circuits, and the default mode network (DMN), the latter three to examine 
higher-order brain regions. The results indicate that, while fc-fMRI patterns 
did not significantly differ (p<0.005; 20-voxel cluster threshold) in sensory 
cortex and in the DMN between the pre- and anesthetized conditions, fc-fMRI in 
high-order cognitive regions (i.e. memory and pain circuits) was significantly 
altered by anesthesia. These findings provide further evidence that fc-fMRI 
reflects intrinsic brain properties, while also demonstrating that 0.5 MAC 
sevoflurane anesthesia preferentially modulates higher-order connections.

OBJECTIVES: The cerebellar vermis is increasingly implicated in bipolar disorder 
(BD). In this study, we investigated vermis morphology in BD using a 
quantitative volumetric analysis.
METHODS: Volumes for total vermis and vermis subregions V1 (lobules I-V), V2 
(lobules VI-VII), and V3 (lobules VIII-X) were calculated using high-resolution 
structural magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 44 individuals with BD (25 
females and 19 males) and 43 healthy comparison (HC) subjects (26 females and 17 
males). Total vermis volumes were compared between the BD and HC groups. 
Potential effects of vermis subregions and clinical features were explored.
RESULTS: Total vermis volumes were significantly larger in the BD group than in 
the HC group (p = 0.02). There was a significant group-by-sex interaction (p = 
0.02). Total vermis volumes were significantly larger in males with BD than HC 
males (p = 0.004); vermis volumes did not differ significantly between females 
with and without BD (p = 0.95). Subregion analyses showed a trend-level 
interaction between diagnosis and subregion (p = 0.07) in which subregion V1 
volumes were significantly larger in BD participants (p = 0.001), with 
differences primarily driven by males (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate increases in cerebellar vermis volumes in 
males with BD. These findings support the presence of structural alterations in 
the cerebellar vermis in BD and furthermore the influence of sex on such 
changes.

PURPOSE: In planning epilepsy surgery, it is important to be able to assess the 
likelihood of success of surgery for each patient so that the possible risk and 
benefit can be properly considered. In this study, functional connectivity was 
investigated as a means for predicting surgical outcome from the preoperative 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of epilepsy patients.
METHODS: Resting-state simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI data were 
collected from 18 patients with intractable epilepsy before surgery and from 14 
healthy subjects. For each patient, EEG-spike correlated fMRI analysis was 
performed and an activation cluster that overlapped the most with the planned 
resection area for each patient was chosen as the seed for the functional 
connectivity analysis. After the functional connectivity maps were computed, 
laterality indices of functional connectivity were contrasted between patients 
who had seizures after surgeries (seizure-recurrence group) and those who did 
not have them for at least a year (seizure-free group).
KEY FINDINGS: Patients in the seizure-recurrence group had less-lateralized 
functional connectivity than patients in the seizure-free group (t(16) = 2.3, 
after control subtracted and Fisher transformed, p < 0.05, two-tailed).
SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests the potential for using preoperative fMRI 
connectivity analysis as a predictive outcome measure. If confirmed by further 
research, a high laterality will be an important addition to the other 
predictors of better surgical outcome such as febrile seizures, mesial temporal 
sclerosis, tumors, abnormal MRI, and EEG/MRI concordance.

Intentional movement is an internally driven process that requires the 
integration of motivational and sensory cues with motor preparedness. In 
addition to the motor cortical-basal ganglia circuits, the limbic circuits are 
also involved in the integration of these cues. Individuals with Parkinson's 
disease (PD) have a particular difficulty with internally generating intentional 
movements and maintaining the speed, size, and vigor of movements. This 
difficulty improves when they are provided with external cues suggesting that 
there is a problem with the internal motivation of movement in PD. The 
prevailing view attributes this difficulty in PD to the dysfunction of motor 
cortical-basal ganglia circuits. First, we argue that the standard 
cortical-basal ganglia circuit model of motor dysfunction in PD needs to be 
expanded to include the insula which is a major hub within the limbic circuits. 
We propose a neural circuit model highlighting the interaction between the 
insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex which is involved in generating 
intentional movements. The insula processes a wide range of sensory signals 
arising from the body and integrates them with the emotional and motivational 
context. In doing so, it provides the impetus to the dorsomedial frontal cortex 
to initiate and sustain movement. Second, we present the results of our 
proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating that the functional connectivity of 
the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex circuit can be enhanced with 
neurofeedback-guided kinesthetic motor imagery using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging in subjects with PD. Specifically, we found that the intensity 
and quality of body sensations evoked during motor imagery and the emotional and 
motivational context of motor imagery determined the direction (i.e., negative 
or positive) of the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. 
After 10-12 neurofeedback sessions and "off-line" practice of the successful 
motor imagery strategies all subjects showed a significant increase in the 
insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. Finally, we discuss 
the implications of these results regarding motor function in patients with PD 
and propose suggestions for future studies.

PURPOSE: To investigate algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) for parallel 
imaging reconstruction of radial data, applied to accelerated cardiac cine.
METHODS: A graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated ART reconstruction was 
implemented and applied to simulations, point spread functions and in 12 
subjects imaged with radial cardiac cine acquisitions. Cine images were 
reconstructed with radial ART at multiple undersampling levels (192 Nr × Np 
 = 96 to 16). Images were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for 
sharpness and artifacts, and compared to filtered back-projection, and conjugate 
gradient SENSE.
RESULTS: Radial ART provided reduced artifacts and mainly preserved spatial 
resolution, for both simulations and in vivo data. Artifacts were qualitatively 
and quantitatively less with ART than filtered back-projection using 48, 32, and 
24 Np , although filtered back-projection provided quantitatively sharper images 
at undersampling levels of 48-24 Np (all P < 0.05). Use of undersampled radial 
data for generating auto-calibrated coil-sensitivity profiles resulted in 
slightly reduced quality. ART was comparable to conjugate gradient SENSE. 
GPU-acceleration increased ART reconstruction speed 15-fold, with little impact 
on the images.
CONCLUSION: GPU-accelerated ART is an alternative approach to image 
reconstruction for parallel radial MR imaging, providing reduced artifacts while 
mainly maintaining sharpness compared to filtered back-projection, as shown by 
its first application in cardiac studies.

We present a novel voxel-based connectivity approach for paired functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected under two different conditions 
labeled the Coupled Intrinsic Connectivity Distribution (coupled-ICD). Our 
proposed method jointly models both conditions to incorporate additional paired 
information into the connectivity metric. Voxel-based connectivity holds promise 
as a clinical tool to characterize a wide range of neurological and psychiatric 
diseases, and monitor their treatment. As such, examining paired connectivity 
data such as scans acquired pre- and post-intervention is an important 
application for connectivity methodologically. When presented with data from 
paired conditions, conventional voxel-based methods analyze each condition 
separately. However, summarizing each connection separately can misrepresent 
patterns of changes in connectivity. We show that commonly used methods can 
underestimate functional changes and subsequently introduce and evaluate our 
solution to this problem, the coupled-ICD metric, using two studies: 1) healthy 
controls scanned awake and under anesthesia, and 2) cocaine-dependent subjects 
and healthy controls scanned while being presented with relaxing or drug-related 
imagery cues. The coupled-ICD approach detected differences between paired 
conditions in similar brain regions as the conventional approaches while also 
revealing additional changes in regions not identified using conventional 
voxel-based connectivity analyses. Follow-up seed-based analyses on data 
independent from the voxel-based results also showed connectivity differences 
between conditions in regions detected by coupled-ICD. This approach of jointly 
analyzing paired resting-state scans provides a new and important tool with many 
applications for clinical and basic neuroscience research.

The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of emotional responses such 
as fear, and a number of studies have implicated endocannabinoid signaling in 
anxiety. The fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) C385A polymorphism, which is 
associated with enhanced endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, has been 
identified across species as a potential protective factor from anxiety. In 
particular, adults with the variant FAAH 385A allele have greater 
fronto-amygdala connectivity and lower anxiety symptoms. Whether broader 
network-level differences in connectivity exist, and when during development 
this neural phenotype emerges, remains unknown and represents an important next 
step in understanding how the FAAH C385A polymorphism impacts neurodevelopment 
and risk for anxiety disorders. Here, we leveraged data from 3,109 participants 
in the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study℠ 
(10.04 ± 0.62 years old; 44.23% female, 55.77% male) and a cross-validated, 
data-driven approach to examine associations between genetic variation and 
large-scale resting-state brain networks. Our findings revealed a distributed 
brain network, comprising functional connections that were both significantly 
greater (95% CI for p values = [<0.001, <0.001]) and lesser (95% CI for p 
values = [0.006, <0.001]) in A-allele carriers relative to non-carriers. 
Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between genotype and the 
summarized connectivity of functional connections that were greater in A-allele 
carriers, such that non-carriers with connectivity more similar to A-allele 
carriers (i.e., greater connectivity) had lower anxiety symptoms (β = -0.041, 
p = 0.030). These findings provide novel evidence of network-level changes in 
neural connectivity associated with genetic variation in endocannabinoid 
signaling and suggest that genotype-associated neural differences may emerge at 
a younger age than genotype-associated differences in anxiety.

Numerous studies have shown that the hippocampus is critical for spatial memory. 
Within nonhuman research, a task often used to assess spatial memory is the 
radial arm maze. Because of the spatial nature of this task, this maze is often 
used to assess the function of the hippocampus. Our goal was to extrapolate this 
task to humans and examine whether healthy undergraduates utilize their 
hippocampus while performing a virtual reality version of the radial arm maze 
task. Thirteen undergraduates performed a virtual radial arm maze during 
functional magnetic resonance imaging. The brain maps of activity reveal 
bilateral hippocampal BOLD signal changes during the performance of this task. 
However, paradoxically, this BOLD signal change decreases during the spatial 
memory component of the task. Additionally, we note frontal cortex activity 
reflective of working memory circuits. These data reveal that, as predicted by 
the rodent literature, the hippocampus is involved in performing the virtual 
radial arm maze in humans. Hence, this virtual reality version may be used to 
assess the integrity of hippocampus so as to predict risk or severity in a 
variety of psychiatric disorders.

BACKGROUND: Cocaine-dependent individuals demonstrate neural and behavioral 
differences compared to healthy comparison subjects when performing the Stroop 
color-word interference test. Stroop measures also relate to treatment outcome 
for cocaine dependence. Intrinsic connectivity analyses assess the extent to 
which task-related regional brain activations are related to each other in the 
absence of defining a priori regions of interest.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined 1) the extent to which cocaine-dependent and 
non-addicted individuals differed on measures of intrinsic connectivity during 
fMRI Stroop performance; and 2) the relationships between fMRI Stroop intrinsic 
connectivity and treatment outcome in cocaine dependence.
METHODS: Sixteen treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent patients and matched 
non-addicted comparison subjects completed an fMRI Stroop task. Between-group 
differences in intrinsic connectivity were assessed and related to self-reported 
and urine-toxicology-based cocaine-abstinence measures.
RESULTS: Cocaine-dependent patients vs. comparison subjects showed less 
intrinsic connectivity in cortical and subcortical regions. When adjusting for 
individual degree of intrinsic connectivity, cocaine-dependent vs. comparison 
subjects showed relatively greater intrinsic connectivity in the ventral 
striatum, putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, thalamus and 
substantia nigra. Non-mean-adjusted intrinsic-connectivity measures in the 
midbrain, thalamus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, insula and hippocampus 
negatively correlated with measures of cocaine abstinence.
CONCLUSION: The diminished intrinsic connectivity in cocaine-dependent vs. 
comparison subjects suggests poorer communication across brain regions during 
cognitive-control processes. In mean-adjusted analyses, the cocaine-dependent 
group displayed relatively greater Stroop-related connectivity in regions 
implicated in motivational processes in addictions. The relationships between 
treatment outcomes and connectivity in the midbrain and basal ganglia suggest 
that connectivity represents a potential treatment target.

We present new evidence based on fMRI for the existence and neural architecture 
of an abstract supramodal language system that can integrate linguistic inputs 
arising from different modalities such that speech and print each activate a 
common code. Working with sentence material, our aim was to find out where the 
putative supramodal system is located and how it responds to comprehension 
challenges. To probe these questions we examined BOLD activity in experienced 
readers while they performed a semantic categorization task with matched written 
or spoken sentences that were either well-formed or contained anomalies of 
syntactic form or pragmatic content. On whole-brain scans, both anomalies 
increased net activity over non-anomalous baseline sentences, chiefly at left 
frontal and temporal regions of heteromodal cortex. The anomaly-sensitive sites 
correspond approximately to those that previous studies (Michael et al., 2001; 
Constable et al., 2004) have found to be sensitive to other differences in 
sentence complexity (object relative minus subject relative). Regions of 
interest (ROIs) were defined by peak response to anomaly averaging over modality 
conditions. Each anomaly-sensitive ROI showed the same pattern of response 
across sentence types in each modality. Voxel-by-voxel exploration over the 
whole brain based on a cosine similarity measure of common function confirmed 
the specificity of supramodal zones.

MRI has the potential of providing a noninvasive assessment of liver pathology. 
This work introduces a portal pressure gradient (PPG) model derived from fluid 
mechanics, where the PPG is proportional to the average velocity and inversely 
proportional to the vessel area in the upper part of portal vein. Using a 
phase-contrast spoiled gradient echo sequence, the PPG model was verified in a 
phantom study and was tested in an animal study using 35 rats with various 
degrees of hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). 
Histological examination was conducted to determine the severity of hepatic 
fibrosis. The fibrosis score monotonically increased with the duration of CCl(4) 
treatment. The PPG was highly correlated with nonzero fibrosis scores (r(2) = 
0.90, P < 0.05). There was a significant difference between control and 
cirrhosis groups (P < 0.0006, alpha < 0.0018). The difference between control 
and fibrosis (noncirrhosis) groups (P < 0.002, alpha < 0.006) was also 
significant. Without the administration of any contrast agent, the MRI-PPG 
approach shows promise as a noninvasive means of evaluating liver fibrosis.

Very low birth weight preterm (PT) children are at high risk for brain injury. 
Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we tested the hypothesis that PT 
adolescents would demonstrate microstructural white matter disorganization 
relative to term controls at 16 years of age. Forty-four PT subjects (600-1250 g 
birth weight) without neonatal brain injury and 41 term controls were evaluated 
at age 16 years with DTI, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III 
(WISC), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT), and the 
Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). PT subjects scored lower 
than term subjects on WISC full scale (p=0.003), verbal (p=0.043), and 
performance IQ tests (p=0.001), as well as CTOPP phonological awareness 
(p=0.004), but scored comparably to term subjects on PPVT and CTOPP Rapid Naming 
tests. PT subjects had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in multiple 
regions including bilateral uncinate fasciculi (left: p=0.01; right: p=0.004), 
bilateral external capsules (left: p<0.001; right: p<0.001), the splenium of the 
corpus callosum (p=0.008), and white matter serving the inferior frontal gyrus 
bilaterally (left: p<0.001; right: p=0.011). FA values in both the left and 
right uncinate fasciculi correlated with PPVT scores (a semantic language task) 
in the PT subjects (left: r=0.314, p=0.038; right: r=0.336, p=0.026). FA values 
in the left and right arcuate fasciculi correlated with CTOPP Rapid Naming 
scores (a phonologic task) in the PT subjects (left: r=0.424, p=0.004; right: 
r=0.301, p=0.047). These data support for the first time that dual pathways 
underlying language function are present in PT adolescents. The striking 
bilateral dorsal correlations for the PT group suggest that prematurely born 
subjects rely more heavily on the right hemisphere than typically developing 
adults for performance of phonological language tasks. These findings may 
represent either a delay in maturation or the engagement of alternative neural 
pathways for language in the developing PT brain.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of auditory verbal hallucinations remains poorly 
understood.
AIMS: To characterise the time course of regional brain activity leading to 
auditory verbal hallucinations.
METHOD: During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 11 patients with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder signalled auditory verbal 
hallucination events by pressing a button. To control for effects of motor 
behaviour, regional activity associated with hallucination events was scaled 
against corresponding activity arising from random button-presses produced by 10 
patients who did not experience hallucinations.
RESULTS: Immediately prior to the hallucinations, motor-adjusted activity in the 
left inferior frontal gyrus was significantly greater than corresponding 
activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, motor-adjusted 
activity in a right posterior temporal region overshadowed corresponding 
activity in the left homologous temporal region. Robustly elevated 
motor-adjusted activity in the left temporal region associated with auditory 
verbal hallucinations was also detected, but only subsequent to hallucination 
events. At the earliest time shift studied, the correlation between left 
inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal activity was significantly higher for 
the hallucination group compared with non-hallucinating patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that heightened functional coupling between the 
left inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal regions leads to coactivation in 
these speech processing regions that is hallucinogenic. Delayed left temporal 
activation may reflect impaired corollary discharge contributing to source 
misattribution of resulting verbal images.

Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) are often modulated in human electroencephalogram 
(EEG) studies of memory, whereas overlapping frequencies dominate rodent 
hippocampal EEG. An emerging parallelism between theta reactivity and 
hippocampal functional magnetic resonance imaging activation has suggested a 
homology between theta activity in humans and rodents, representing a process of 
cortico-hippocampal interaction involved in memory. In the present study, we 
investigated EEG reactivity during performance of a relational memory task that 
induces a negative hippocampal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal 
change, compared to a nonrelational control condition. Relational trials induced 
theta increases and alpha decreases. Low Resolution Electromagnetic Brain 
Tomography estimates localized theta and alpha modulation to frontal midline and 
parietal midline cortices, respectively, both of which exhibit negative BOLD 
responses in this task. Thus, theta and alpha dynamics are dissociable from 
positive BOLD activation, and may, in fact, colocalize with negative BOLD 
responses.

BACKGROUND: Experimental changes in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) affect 
task-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. Since patients 
with schizophrenia have been shown to have abnormal resting CBF, we sought to 
determine whether differences between patients and healthy controls in resting 
CBF contribute to group differences in BOLD response.
METHODS: BOLD images were acquired in nineteen patients and twenty healthy 
controls looking at photographs of faces, and resting CBF was measured by 
arterial spinning labeling. Resting CBF was then used to adjust group 
differences in task-related BOLD signal increases in linear models.
RESULTS: Patients had different resting CBF from healthy controls in right basal 
ganglion and bilateral thalami. Associations between resting CBF and delta BOLD 
were evident in bilateral prefrontal areas, visual processing areas and right 
fusiform gyrus. Other areas showed significant three-way interactions among 
group, delta BOLD and resting CBF. Incorporating resting CBF when modeling group 
differences in BOLD responses identified areas of group differences in 
task-related delta BOLD response that were not evident in simple group 
contrasts. These were in right inferior frontal cortex, left insula, left middle 
frontal cortex and bilateral frontal poles.
CONCLUSION: Adjusting for inter-group differences in resting CBF altered 
inter-group differences in task-related BOLD response in some areas, suggesting 
that assessing resting CBF in task-related BOLD studies could increase 
sensitivity and validity. In multiple regions, the relationship between resting 
CBF and task-related signal increases in BOLD differed between patients and 
controls, providing new evidence of possible metabolic and/or vascular 
pathology.

Converging data suggest recovery from injury in the preterm brain. We used 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that 
cerebral connectivity involving Wernicke's area and other important cortical 
language regions would differ between preterm (PT) and term (T) control school 
age children during performance of an auditory language task. Fifty-four PT 
children (600-1250 g birth weight) and 24 T controls were evaluated using an 
fMRI passive language task and neurodevelopmental assessments including: the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - III (WISC-III), the Peabody 
Individual Achievement Test - Revised (PIAT-R) and the Peabody Picture 
Vocabulary Test - Revised (PPVT-R) at 8 years of age. Neural activity was 
assessed for language processing and the data were evaluated for connectivity 
and correlations to cognitive outcomes. We found that PT subjects scored 
significantly lower on all components of the WISC-III (p<0.009), the PIAT-R 
Reading Comprehension test (p=0.013), and the PPVT-R (p=0.001) compared to term 
subjects. Connectivity analyses revealed significantly stronger neural circuits 
in PT children between Wernicke's area and the right inferior frontal gyrus (R 
IFG, Broca's area homologue) and both the left and the right supramarginal gyri 
(SMG) components of the inferior parietal lobules (p</=0.02 for all). We 
conclude that PT subjects employ neural systems for auditory language function 
at school age differently than T controls; these alterations may represent a 
delay in maturation of neural networks or the engagement of alternate circuits 
for language processing.

Obesity is a worldwide epidemic resulting in part from the ubiquity of 
high-calorie foods and food images. Whether obese and nonobese individuals 
regulate their desire to consume high-calorie foods differently is not clear. We 
set out to investigate the hypothesis that circulating levels of glucose, the 
primary fuel source for the brain, influence brain regions that regulate the 
motivation to consume high-calorie foods. Using functional MRI (fMRI) combined 
with a stepped hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp and behavioral 
measures of interest in food, we have shown here that mild hypoglycemia 
preferentially activates limbic-striatal brain regions in response to food cues 
to produce a greater desire for high-calorie foods. In contrast, euglycemia 
preferentially activated the medial prefrontal cortex and resulted in less 
interest in food stimuli. Indeed, higher circulating glucose levels predicted 
greater medial prefrontal cortex activation, and this response was absent in 
obese subjects. These findings demonstrate that circulating glucose modulates 
neural stimulatory and inhibitory control over food motivation and suggest that 
this glucose-linked restraining influence is lost in obesity. Strategies that 
temper postprandial reductions in glucose levels might reduce the risk of 
overeating, particularly in environments inundated with visual cues of 
high-calorie foods.

Despite behavioral evidence that variation in ovarian hormones is associated 
with changes in affect, the neural basis of these processes is poorly 
understood. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 
quantitative analysis of ovarian hormones in a within-subject design to 
investigate brain activation patterns during affective response inhibition, 
comparing activation between the early follicular (low estrogen and 
progesterone) and mid-luteal (high estrogen and progesterone) phases of the 
menstrual cycle in healthy women. There was significantly increased activation 
in the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while 
inhibiting response to positive words during the luteal, compared to the 
follicular phase. Furthermore, luteal phase estradiol level positively 
correlated with DLPFC activation while inhibiting response to positive words and 
negatively correlated with activation in several structures while inhibiting 
response to negative words, supporting estrogen's modulation of affective 
processing.

AIM: To examine individual variability between perceived physical features and 
hormones of pubertal maturation in 9-10-year-old children as a function of 
sociodemographic characteristics.
METHODS: Cross-sectional metrics of puberty were utilized from the baseline 
assessment of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study-a 
multi-site sample of 9-10 year-olds (n = 11,875)-and included perceived physical 
features via the pubertal development scale (PDS) and child salivary hormone 
levels (dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone in all, and estradiol in 
females). Multi-level models examined the relationships among sociodemographic 
measures, physical features, and hormone levels. A group factor analysis (GFA) 
was implemented to extract latent variables of pubertal maturation that 
integrated both measures of perceived physical features and hormone levels.
RESULTS: PDS summary scores indicated more males (70%) than females (31%) were 
prepubertal. Perceived physical features and hormone levels were significantly 
associated with child's weight status and income, such that more mature scores 
were observed among children that were overweight/obese or from households with 
low-income. Results from the GFA identified two latent factors that described 
individual differences in pubertal maturation among both females and males, with 
factor 1 driven by higher hormone levels, and factor 2 driven by perceived 
physical maturation. The correspondence between latent factor 1 scores 
(hormones) and latent factor 2 scores (perceived physical maturation) revealed 
synchronous and asynchronous relationships between hormones and concomitant 
physical features in this large young adolescent sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic measures were associated with both objective 
hormone and self-report physical measures of pubertal maturation in a large, 
diverse sample of 9-10 year-olds. The latent variables of pubertal maturation 
described a complex interplay between perceived physical changes and hormone 
levels that hallmark sexual maturation, which future studies can examine in 
relation to trajectories of brain maturation, risk/resilience to substance use, 
and other mental health outcomes.

Recent data suggest recovery of language systems but persistent structural 
abnormalities in the prematurely born. We tested the hypothesis that subjects 
who were born prematurely develop alternative networks for processing language. 
Subjects who were born prematurely (n = 22; 600-1250 g birth weight), without 
neonatal brain injury on neonatal cranial ultrasound, and 26 term control 
subjects were examined with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
semantic association task, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III 
(WISC-III) and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). 
In-magnet task accuracy and response times were calculated, and fMRI data were 
evaluated for the effect of group on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) 
activation, the correlation between task accuracy and activation and the 
functional connectivity between regions activating to task. Although there were 
differences in verbal IQ and CELF scores between the preterm (PT) and term 
control groups, there were no significant differences for either accuracy or 
response time for the in-magnet task. Both groups activated classic semantic 
processing areas including the left superior and middle temporal gyri and 
inferior frontal gyrus, and there was no significant difference in activation 
patterns between groups. Clear differences between the groups were observed in 
the correlation between task accuracy and activation to task at P < 0.01, 
corrected for multiple comparisons. Left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with 
accuracy only for term controls and left sensory motor areas correlated with 
accuracy only for PT subjects. Left middle temporal gyri correlated with task 
accuracy for both groups. Connectivity analyses at P < 0.001 revealed the 
importance of a circuit between left middle temporal gyri and inferior frontal 
gyrus for both groups. In addition, the PT subjects evidenced greater 
connectivity between traditional language areas and sensory motor areas but 
significantly fewer correlated areas within the frontal lobes when compared to 
term controls. We conclude that at 12 years of age, children born prematurely 
and children born at term had no difference in performance on a simple lexical 
semantic processing task and activated similar areas. Connectivity analyses, 
however, suggested that PT subjects rely upon different neural pathways for 
lexical semantic processing when compared to term controls. Plasticity in 
network connections may provide the substrate for improving language skills in 
the prematurely born.

Primary auditory cortex (PAC), located in Heschl's gyrus (HG), is the earliest 
cortical level at which sounds are processed. Standard theories of speech 
perception assume that signal components are given a representation in PAC which 
are then matched to speech templates in auditory association cortex. An 
alternative holds that speech activates a specialized system in cortex that does 
not use the primitives of PAC. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
different brain activation patterns in listening to speech and nonspeech sounds 
across different levels of complexity. Sensitivity to speech was observed in 
association cortex, as expected. Further, activation in HG increased with 
increasing levels of complexity with added fundamentals for both nonspeech and 
speech stimuli, but only for nonspeech when separate sources (release 
bursts/fricative noises or their nonspeech analogs) were added. These results 
are consistent with the existence of a specialized speech system which bypasses 
more typical processes at the earliest cortical level.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in cognition and emotion. In the 
classic Stroop task, presentation of stimuli that are in response conflict with 
one another produces activation in the caudal ACC. In the emotional Stroop task, 
presentation of emotionally salient stimuli produces activation in the rostral 
ACC. Presentation of stimuli that are emotionally conflicting should activate 
the caudal ACC; stimuli that are emotionally salient should activate the rostral 
ACC. We tested this prediction using functional magnetic resonance imaging while 
subjects made emotional valence judgments of words overlaid on emotional faces 
(word-face Stroop task). Emotionally incongruent pairs were responded to more 
slowly than emotionally congruent pairs. Emotionally incongruent trials were 
associated with increased activation within the caudal ACC, whereas no ACC 
activation was found in response to emotional saliency. These results support 
the conflict-monitoring model of caudal ACC and extend this function to conflict 
within the domain of emotional stimuli.

OBJECTIVES: Identifying hubs of brain dysfunction in adolescents and young 
adults with Bipolar I Disorder (BDAYA ) could provide targets for early 
detection, prevention and treatment. Previous neuroimaging studies across mood 
states of BDAYA are scarce and often examined limited brain regions potentially 
prohibiting detection of other important regions. We used a data-driven 
whole-brain Intrinsic Connectivity Distribution (ICD) approach to investigate 
dysconnectivity hubs across mood states in BDAYA .
METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging whole brain ICD data was 
investigated for differences across 4 groups: BDAYA -depressed (n=28), BDAYA 
-euthymic (n=47), BDAYA -elevated (n=27) and healthy controls (HC, n=111). 
Clusters of ICD differences were assessed for regional dysconnectivity and mood 
symptom relationships. Analyses were also performed for BDAYA overall (vs. HC) 
ICD differences persisting across mood states.
RESULTS: ICD was higher in the BDAYA- depressed group than other groups in 
bilateral ventral/rostral/dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right lenticular 
nucleus (LN) (pcorrected <0.05). In BDAYA -depressed, FC was increased between 
these regions with their contralateral homologues and PFC-medial temporal FC was 
more negative (p<0.005). PFC-related findings correlated with depression scores 
(p<0.05). The overall BDAYA group showed ICD increases in more ventral left PFC 
and right cerebellum, present across euthymia and acute mood states.
CONCLUSIONS: This ICD approach supports a PFC hub of inter- and 
intra-hemispheric frontotemporal dysconnectivity in BDAYA with potential trait 
features and disturbances of higher magnitude during depression. Hubs were also 
revealed in LN and cerebellum, less common foci of BD research. The hubs are 
potential targets for early interventions to detect, prevent and treat BD.

Prematurely born children are at increased risk for language deficits at school 
age and beyond, but the neurobiological basis of these findings remains poorly 
understood. Thirty-one PT adolescents (600-1250g birth weight) and 36 T controls 
were evaluated using an fMRI passive language task and neurodevelopmental 
assessments including: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III 
(WISC-III), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R), the 
Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) and the Test of Word 
Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) at 16years of age. Neural activity was assessed for 
language processing and the data were evaluated for connectivity and 
correlations to cognitive outcomes. PT subjects scored significantly lower on 
all components of the WISC-III (p<0.05) compared to term subjects, but there was 
no significant difference in PPVT-R scores between the groups. Functional 
connectivity (fcMRI) between Wernicke's area (left BA 22) and the right 
supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) was increased in preterm subjects relative to term 
controls (p=0.03), and the strength of this connection was inversely related to 
performance on both the PPVT-R (R(2)=0.553, p=0.002), and the verbal 
comprehension index (R(2)=0.439, p=0.019). Preterm adolescents engage a dorsal 
right hemisphere region for language at age 16years. Those with the greatest 
cognitive deficits demonstrate increasing reliance on this alternate pathway.

The aim of this study was to dissociate the contributions of memory-based 
(cognitive) and adaptation-based (sensory) mechanisms underlying deviance 
detection in the context of natural speech. Twenty healthy right-handed native 
speakers of English participated in an event-related design scan in which 
natural speech stimuli, /de:/ ("deh") and /deI/ ("day"); (/te:/ ("teh") and 
/teI/ ("tay") served as standards and deviants within functional magnetic 
resonance imaging event-related "oddball" paradigm designed to elicit the 
mismatch negativity component. Thus, "oddball" blocks could involve either a 
word deviant ("day") resulting in a "word advantage" effect, or a non-word 
deviant ("deh" or "tay"). We utilized an experimental protocol controlling for 
refractoriness similar to that used previously when deviance detection was 
studied in the context of tones. Results showed that the cognitive and sensory 
mechanisms of deviance detection were located in the anterior and posterior 
auditory cortices, respectively, as was previously found in the context of 
tones. The cognitive effect, that was most robust for the word deviant, 
diminished in the "oddball" condition. In addition, the results indicated that 
the lexical status of the speech stimulus interacts with acoustic factors 
exerting a top-down modulation of the extent to which novel sounds gain access 
to the subject's awareness through memory-based processes. Thus, the more 
salient the deviant stimulus is the more likely it is to be released from the 
effects of adaptation exerted by the posterior auditory cortex.

OBJECTIVE: In the U.S., an astonishing 12.5 million children and adolescents are 
now obese, predisposing 17% of our nation's youth to metabolic complications of 
obesity, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adolescent obesity has tripled over the 
last three decades in the setting of food advertising directed at children. 
Obese adults exhibit increased brain responses to food images in 
motivation-reward pathways. These neural alterations may be attributed to 
obesity-related metabolic changes, which promote food craving and high-calorie 
food (HCF) consumption. It is not known whether these metabolic changes affect 
neural responses in the adolescent brain during a crucial period for 
establishing healthy eating behaviors.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five obese (BMI 34.4 kg/m2, age 15.7 years) 
and fifteen lean (BMI 20.96 kg/m2, age 15.5 years) adolescents underwent 
functional MRI during exposure to HCF, low-calorie food (LCF), and nonfood (NF) 
visual stimuli 2 h after isocaloric meal consumption.
RESULTS: Brain responses to HCF relative to NF cues increased in obese versus 
lean adolescents in striatal-limbic regions (i.e., putamen/caudate, insula, 
amygdala) (P < 0.05, family-wise error [FWE]), involved in motivation-reward and 
emotion processing. Higher endogenous leptin levels correlated with increased 
neural activation to HCF images in all subjects (P < 0.05, FWE).
CONCLUSIONS: This significant association between higher circulating leptin and 
hyperresponsiveness of brain motivation-reward regions to HCF images suggests 
that dysfunctional leptin signaling may contribute to the risk of 
overconsumption of these foods, thus further predisposing adolescents to the 
development of obesity and T2D.

Fatty liver is increasingly common in obese adolescents. We determined its 
association with glucose dysregulation in 118 (37M/81F) obese adolescents of 
similar age and percent total fat. Fast-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
simple MRI were used to quantify hepatic fat content and abdominal fat 
distribution. All subjects had a standard oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin 
sensitivity was estimated by the Matsuda Index and homeostasis model assessment 
of insulin resistance. Baseline total and high molecular weight 
(HMW)-adiponectin and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were measured. The cohort was 
stratified according to tertiles of hepatic fat content. Whereas age and %fat 
were comparable across tertiles, ethnicity differed in that fewer Blacks and 
more Whites and Hispanics were in the moderate and high category of hepatic fat 
fraction (HFF). Visceral and the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio increased 
and insulin sensitivity decreased across tertiles. Two-hour plasma glucose rose 
with increasing hepatic steatosis (P < 0.008). 73.7% of the subjects in the high 
HFF had the metabolic syndrome compared to 19.5% and 30.6%, respectively, in the 
low and moderate categories. Both total and HMW-adiponectin decreased, and IL-6 
increased with increasing hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSION: In obese adolescents, independent of total fat, increasing severity 
of fatty liver is associated with glucose dysregulation, metabolic syndrome, and 
with a proinflammatory milieu.

Functional connectivity between task-positive and task-negative brain areas and 
its relation to working memory performance.

Functional brain imaging studies have identified a set of brain areas typically 
activated during cognitive tasks (task-positive brain areas) and another set of 
brain areas typically deactivated during cognitive tasks (task-negative brain 
areas). Negative correlations, or anticorrelations, between task-positive and 
task-negative brain areas have been reported at rest. Furthermore, the strength 
of these anticorrelations appears to be related to cognitive function. However, 
studies examining anticorrelations have typically employed global regression or 
similar analysis steps that force anticorrelated relationships to exist between 
brain areas. Therefore the validity of these findings has been questioned. Here 
we examine anticorrelations between a task-negative region in the medial frontal 
gyrus/anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a classic 
task-positive area, using an analysis that does not include global regression. 
Instead, we control for whole-brain correlations in the group-level analysis. 
Using this approach, we demonstrate that the strength of the functional 
connection between the medial frontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex is related to cognitive function and that this relationship is not an 
artifact of global regression.

procedure.

PURPOSE: This work examines the efficacy of functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) for language lateralization using a comprehensive three-task 
language-mapping approach. Two localization methods and four different metrics 
for quantifying activation within hemisphere are compared and validated with 
Wada testing. Sources of discordance between fMRI and Wada lateralization are 
discussed with respect to specific patient examples.
METHODS: fMRI language mapping was performed in patients with epilepsy (N = 40) 
using reading sentence comprehension, auditory sentence comprehension, and a 
verbal fluency task. This was compared with the Wada procedure using both 
whole-brain and midline exclusion-based analyses. Different laterality scores 
were examined as a function of statistical threshold to investigate the 
sensitivity to threshold effects.
RESULTS: For the lateralized patients categorized by Wada, fMRI laterality 
indices (LIs) were concordant with the Wada procedure results in 83.87% patients 
for the reading task, 83.33% patients for the auditory task, 76.92% patients for 
the verbal fluency task, and in 91.3% patients for the conjunction analysis. The 
patients categorized as bilateral via the Wada procedure showed some hemispheric 
dominance in fMRI, and discrepancies between the Wada test findings and the 
functional laterality scores arose for a range of reasons.
DISCUSSION: Discordance was dependent upon whether whole-brain or midline 
exclusion method-based lateralization was calculated, and in the former case the 
inclusion of the occipital and other midline regions often negatively influenced 
the lateralization scores. Overall fMRI was in agreement with the Wada test in 
91.3% of patients, suggesting its utility for clinical use with the proper 
consideration given to the confounds discussed in this work.

Anesthesia-induced changes in functional connectivity and cerebral blow flow 
(CBF) in large-scale brain networks have emerged as key markers of reduced 
consciousness. However, studies of functional connectivity disagree on which 
large-scale networks are altered or preserved during anesthesia, making it 
difficult to find a consensus amount studies. Additionally, pharmacological 
alterations in CBF could amplify or occlude changes in connectivity due to the 
shared variance between CBF and connectivity. Here, we used data-driven 
connectivity methods and multi-modal imaging to investigate shared and unique 
neural correlates of reduced consciousness for connectivity in large-scale brain 
networks. Rs-fMRI and CBF data were collected from the same subjects during an 
awake and deep sedation condition induced by propofol. We measured whole-brain 
connectivity using the intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD), a method not 
reliant on pre-defined seed regions, networks of interest, or connectivity 
thresholds. The shared and unique variance between connectivity and CBF were 
investigated. Finally, to account for shared variance, we present a novel 
extension to ICD that incorporates cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a scaling factor 
in the calculation of global connectivity, labeled CBF-adjusted ICD). We 
observed altered connectivity in multiple large-scale brain networks including 
the default mode (DMN), salience, visual, and motor networks and reduced CBF in 
the DMN, frontoparietal network, and thalamus. Regional connectivity and CBF 
were significantly correlated during both the awake and propofol condition. 
Nevertheless changes in connectivity and CBF between the awake and deep sedation 
condition were only significantly correlated in a subsystem of the DMN, 
suggesting that, while there is significant shared variance between the 
modalities, changes due to propofol are relatively unique. Similar, but less 
significant, results were observed in the CBF-adjusted ICD analysis, providing 
additional evidence that connectivity differences were not fully explained by 
CBF. In conclusion, these results provide further evidence of alterations in 
large-scale brain networks are associated with reduced consciousness and suggest 
that different modalities capture unique aspects of these large scale changes.

Selective attention is thought to be associated with enhanced processing in 
modality-specific cortex. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to 
evaluate brain response during a taste detection task. We demonstrate that 
trying to detect the presence of taste in a tasteless solution results in 
enhanced activity in insula and overlying operculum. The same task does not 
recruit orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Instead, the OFC responds preferentially 
during receipt of an unpredicted taste stimulus. These findings demonstrate 
functional specialization of taste cortex in which the insula and the overlying 
operculum are recruited during taste detection and selective attention to taste, 
and the OFC is recruited during receipt of an unpredicted taste stimulus.

OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the anterior interhemispheric connections provided 
by the corpus callosum (CC) have long been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD). 
In this study, we used complementary diffusion tensor imaging methods to study 
the structural integrity of the CC and localization of potential abnormalities 
in BD.
METHODS: Subjects included 33 participants with BD and 40 healthy comparison 
participants. Fractional anisotropy (FA) measures were compared between groups 
with region of interest (ROI) methods to investigate the anterior, middle, and 
posterior CC and voxel-based methods to further localize abnormalities.
RESULTS: In ROI-based analyses, FA was significantly decreased in the anterior 
and middle CC in the BD group (p < .05). Voxel-based analyses similarly 
localized group differences to the genu, rostral body, and anterior midbody of 
CC (p < .05, corrected).
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate abnormalities in the structural integrity 
of the anterior CC in BD that might contribute to altered interhemispheric 
connectivity in this disorder.

OBJECTIVE: Previous study supports the presence of reduced volume and elevated 
response to emotional stimuli in amygdala in adolescents with bipolar disorder 
(BD). In the present study, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
scans were obtained during the same neuroimaging session to examine amygdala 
structure-function relations in adolescents with BD. We hypothesized that 
amygdala volume would be inversely associated with amygdala response to 
emotional stimuli, such that BD participants with the smallest amygdala volumes 
would exhibit the highest amygdala response.
METHOD: Fifty-one adolescents (21 with BD I and 30 control adolescents, ages 
10-18 years) underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
scans. Amygdala volume (n = 49) and signal change (n = 44) during emotional face 
processing were compared between groups, and structure-function correlations 
were examined within the BD group (n = 16).
RESULTS: Adolescents with BD showed decreased amygdala volume (p =.009) and 
increased amygdala response to emotional faces (p =.043). There was no 
significant interaction between diagnosis and emotion type. A significant 
inverse association between amygdala volume and activation during emotional face 
processing was observed (r = -0.54, p =.029).
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased volume and increased response to emotional stimuli in the 
amygdala in adolescents with BD are consistent with previous reports. This study 
represents the first report, to our knowledge, of the two findings in the same 
adolescent BD sample and supports an amygdala structure-function relation 
characterized by an inverse association between volume and response to emotional 
stimuli. This preliminary finding requires replication and suggests a possible 
pathophysiological link between abnormalities in amygdala structure and response 
to emotional stimuli in BD.

The amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate (AC) have been associated with 
anxiety and mood disorders, for which trait neuroticism is a risk factor. Prior 
work has not related individual differences in amygdala or subgenual AC 
activation with neuroticism. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to 
investigate changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala 
and subgenual AC associated with trait neuroticism in a nonclinical sample of 36 
volunteers during an emotional conflict task. Neuroticism correlated positively 
with amygdala and subgenual AC activation during trials of high emotional 
conflict, compared with trials of low emotional conflict. The subscale of 
neuroticism that reflected the anxious form of neuroticism (N1) explained a 
greater proportion of variance within the observed clusters than the subscale of 
neuroticism that reflected the depressive form of neuroticism (N3). Using a task 
that is sensitive to individual differences in the detection of emotional 
conflict, the authors have provided a neural correlate of the link between 
neuroticism and anxiety and mood disorders. This effect was driven to a greater 
extent by the anxious relative to the depressive characteristics of neuroticism 
and may constitute vulnerability markers for anxiety-related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is clinically useful but of 
limited applicability to small animal models due to poor signal resolution, with 
typical voxel sizes of 1 mm(3) that are insufficient to analyze vessels of 
diameter <1 mm. We determined whether surgically implantable, extravascular MRA 
coils increase signal resolution adequately to examine blood flow dynamics
METHODS: A custom MRA coil was surgically implanted near the carotid artery of a 
New Zealand White rabbit. A stenosis was created in the carotid artery to induce 
complicated, non-laminar flow. Phase contrast images were obtained on multiple 
axial planes with 3T MRA and through-plane velocity profiles were calculated 
under laminar and complicated flow conditions. These velocity profiles were fit 
to a laminar flow model using ordinary least squares in order to quantify the 
degree of flow complication (Matlab). Flow was also measured with a Doppler flow 
probe; vessel diameters and flow velocities were compared with duplex ultrasound
RESULTS: Carotid artery blood flow was 24.7 +/- 2.6 ml/min prior to stenosis 
creation and reduced to 12.0 +/- 1.7 ml/min following injury (n=3). An MRA voxel 
size of 0.1 x 0.1 x 5 mm was achieved. The control carotid artery diameter was 
1.9 +/- 0.1 mm, and cross-sectional images containing 318 +/- 22 voxels were 
acquired (n=26). Velocity profiles resembled laminar flow proximal to the 
stenosis, and then became more complicated just proximal and distal to the 
stenosis. Laminar flow conditions returned downstream of the stenosis
CONCLUSION: Implantable, extra-vascular coils enable small MRA voxel sizes to 
reproducibly calculate complex velocity profiles under both laminar and 
complicated flow in a small animal model. This technique may be applied to study 
blood flow dynamics of vessel remodeling and atherogenesis.

PURPOSE: The relationship between cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) underlies blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI signal. 
This study investigates the potential for improved characterization of the 
CBV-CBF relationship in humans, and examines sex effects as well as spatial 
variations in the CBV-CBF relationship.
METHODS: Healthy subjects were imaged noninvasively at rest and during visual 
stimulation, constituting the first MRI measurement of the absolute CBV-CBF 
relationship in humans with complete coverage of the functional areas of 
interest.
RESULTS: CBV and CBF estimates were consistent with the literature, and their 
relationship varied both spatially and with sex. In a region of interest with 
stimulus-induced activation in CBV and CBF at a significance level of the P < 
0.05, a power function fit resulted in CBV = 2.1 CBF(0.32) across all subjects, 
CBV = 0.8 CBF(0.51) in females and CBV = 4.4 CBF(0.15) in males. Exponents 
decreased in both sexes as ROIs were expanded to include less significantly 
activated regions.
CONCLUSION: Consideration for potential sex-related differences, as well as 
regional variations under a range of physiological states, may reconcile some of 
the variation across literature and advance our understanding of the underlying 
cerebrovascular physiology.

We compared two attentional executive processes: updating, which involved 
attending to a perceptually present stimulus, and refreshing, which involved 
attending to a mentally active representation of a stimulus no longer 
perceptually present. In separate blocks, participants either replaced a word 
being held in working memory with a different word (update), or they thought 
back to a just previously seen word that was no longer perceptually present 
(refresh). Bilateral areas of frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and 
parietal cortex were similarly active for both updating and refreshing, 
suggesting that a common network of areas is recruited to bring information to 
the current focus of attention. In a direct comparison of update and refresh, 
regions more active for update than refresh included regions primarily in right 
frontal cortex, as well as bilateral posterior visual processing regions. 
Regions more active for refresh than update included regions primarily in left 
dorsolateral frontal and left temporal cortex and bilateral inferior frontal 
cortex. These findings help account for the similarity in areas activated across 
different cognitive tasks and may help specify the particular executive 
processes engaged in more complex tasks.

Previous cross-sectional study of ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) implicated 
progressive volume abnormalities during adolescence in bipolar disorder (BD). In 
the present study, a within-subject, longitudinal design was implemented to 
examine brain volume changes during adolescence/young adulthood. We hypothesized 
that VPFC volume decreases over time would be greater in adolescents/young 
adults with BD than in healthy comparison adolescents/young adults. Eighteen 
adolescents/young adults (10 with BD I and 8 healthy comparison participants) 
underwent two high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans over 
approximately 2 years. Regional volume changes over time were measured. 
Adolescents/young adults with BD displayed significantly greater volume loss 
over time, compared to healthy comparison participants, in a region encompassing 
VPFC and rostral PFC and extending to rostral anterior cingulate cortex (p < 
.05). Additional areas where volume change differed between groups were 
observed. While data should be interpreted cautiously due to modest sample size, 
this study provides preliminary evidence to support the presence of accelerated 
loss in VPFC and rostral PFC volume in adolescents/young adults with BD.

Emotion processing deficits are prominent in schizophrenia and exist prior to 
the onset of overt psychosis. However, developmental trajectories of neural 
circuitry subserving emotion regulation and the role that they may play in 
illness onset have not yet been examined in patients at risk for psychosis. The 
present study employed a cross-sectional analysis to examine age-related 
functional activation in amygdala and prefrontal cortex, as well as functional 
connectivity between these regions, in adolescents at clinical high risk (CHR) 
for psychosis relative to typically developing adolescents. Participants (n=34) 
performed an emotion processing fMRI task, including emotion labeling, emotion 
matching, and non-emotional control conditions. Regression analyses were used to 
predict activation in the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) 
based on age, group, sex, and the interaction of age by group. CHR adolescents 
exhibited altered age-related variation in amygdala and vlPFC activation, 
relative to controls. Controls displayed decreased amygdala and increased vlPFC 
activation with age, while patients exhibited the opposite pattern (increased 
amygdala and decreased vlPFC activation), suggesting a failure of prefrontal 
cortex to regulate amygdala reactivity. Moreover, a psychophysiological 
interaction analysis revealed decreased amygdala-prefrontal functional 
connectivity among CHR adolescents, consistent with disrupted brain connectivity 
as a vulnerability factor in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the 
at-risk syndrome is marked by abnormal development and functional connectivity 
of neural systems subserving emotion regulation. Longitudinal data are needed to 
confirm aberrant developmental trajectories intra-individually and to examine 
whether these abnormalities are predictive of conversion to psychosis, and of 
later deficits in socioemotional functioning.

Signal intensity nonuniformities in high field MR imaging limit the ability of 
MRI to provide quantitative information and can negatively impact diagnostic 
scan quality. In this paper, a simple method is described for correcting these 
effects based on in vivo measurement of the transmission field B1+ and reception 
sensitivity maps. These maps can be obtained in vivo with either gradient echo 
(GE) or spin echo (SE) imaging sequences, but the SE approach exhibits an 
advantage over the GE approach for correcting images over a range of flip 
angles. In a uniform phantom, this approach reduced the ratio of the signal SD 
to its mean from around 30% before correction to approximately 6% for the SE 
approach and 9% for the GE approach after correction. The application of the SE 
approach for correcting intensity nonuniformities is demonstrated in vivo with 
human brain images obtained using a conventional spin echo sequence at 3.0 T. 
Furthermore, it is also shown that this in vivo B1+ and reception sensitivity 
mapping can be performed using segmented echo planar imaging sequences providing 
acquisition times of less than 2 min. Although the correction presented here is 
demonstrated with a simultaneous transmit and receive volume coil, it can be 
extended to the case of separate transmission and reception coils, including 
surface and phase array coils.

Correlations between temporal fluctuations in MRI signals may reveal functional 
connectivity between brain regions within individual subjects. Such correlations 
would be especially useful indices of functional connectivity if they covary 
with behavioral performance or other subject variables. This study investigated 
whether such a relationship could be demonstrated in the context of the reading 
circuit in the brain. The method proved sufficiently powerful to reveal 
significant correlations between the reading abilities of subjects and the 
strength of their functional connection between left Brodmann's area 39 and 
Broca's area during reading. This suggests that the disconnection of the angular 
gyrus previously reported for dyslexic readers is part of a larger continuum in 
which poor (but nonimpaired readers) also show reduced connectivity to the 
region. In addition, it illustrates the potential power of paradigms that 
examine correlations between behavior and functional brain connections.

BACKGROUND: Convergent evidence implicates white matter abnormalities in bipolar 
disorder. The cingulum is an important candidate structure for study in bipolar 
disorder as it provides substantial white matter connections within the 
corticolimbic neural system that subserves emotional regulation involved in the 
disorder.
AIMS: To test the hypothesis that bipolar disorder is associated with abnormal 
white matter integrity in the cingulum.
METHOD: Fractional anisotropy in the anterior and posterior cingulum was 
compared between 42 participants with bipolar disorder and 42 healthy 
participants using diffusion tensor imaging.
RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in the anterior 
cingulum in the bipolar disorder group compared with the healthy group 
(P=0.003); however, fractional anisotropy in the posterior cingulum did not 
differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate abnormalities in the structural integrity 
of the anterior cingulum in bipolar disorder. They extend evidence that supports 
involvement of the neural system comprising the anterior cingulate cortex and 
its corticolimbic gray matter connection sites in bipolar disorder to implicate 
abnormalities in the white matter connections within the system provided by the 
cingulum.

Studies of working memory load effects on human EEG power have indicated 
divergent effects in different frequency bands. Although gamma power typically 
increases with load, the load dependency of the lower frequency theta and alpha 
bands is uncertain. We obtained intracranial electroencephalography measurements 
from 1453 electrode sites in 14 epilepsy patients performing a Sternberg task, 
in order to characterize the anatomical distribution of load-related changes 
across the frequency spectrum. Gamma power increases occurred throughout the 
brain, but were most common in the occipital lobe. In the theta and alpha bands, 
both increases and decreases were observed, but with different anatomical 
distributions. Increases in theta and alpha power were most prevalent in frontal 
midline cortex. Decreases were most commonly observed in occipital cortex, 
colocalized with increases in the gamma range, but were also detected in lateral 
frontal and parietal regions. Spatial overlap with group functional magnetic 
resonance imaging results was minimal except in the precentral gyrus. These 
findings suggest that power in any given frequency band is not a unitary 
phenomenon; rather, reactivity in the same frequency band varies in different 
brain regions, and may relate to the engagement or inhibition of a given area in 
a cognitive task.

BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data regarding clinical efficacy of 
acupuncture applied while patients are under general anesthesia. We hypothesize 
that these conflicting data are a result of the inhibitory effect of anesthesia 
on acupuncture-induced central nervous system activity that can be demonstrated 
using magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: Using a crossover study design, volunteers received standardized 
Stomach 36 manual acupuncture in two experimental conditions: while undergoing a 
propofol-based general anesthetic, and while awake. Functional magnetic 
resonance imaging was conducted during both experimental sessions. Paired-t-test 
analyses were performed to examine the differences in acupuncture-induced blood 
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals between awake and anesthesia 
conditions. A secondary analysis was performed to account for the changes in 
regional cerebral blood flow at six regions of interest (thalamus, red nucleus, 
insula, periaqueductal gray, retrosplenial cingular gyri, and the inferior 
temporal region).
RESULTS: Using BOLD, we found significant differences between the two 
experimental sessions in brain areas, including postcentral gyri, retrosplenial 
cingular area, left posterior insula, bilateral precuneus, thalamus, red nuclei, 
and substantia nigra (cluster 100, P < 0.01). A secondary analysis correcting 
for background cerebral blood flow found that BOLD signal differences between 
experimental conditions were not directly caused by changes in regional blood 
flow.
DISCUSSION: Propofol-based anesthesia reduces the neurophysiological response to 
acupuncture stimulation as measured by acupuncture-induced BOLD signals. Further 
work should be conducted to determine the clinical significance of these 
findings.

RATIONALE: Efficient function of neurocircuitry that supports working memory 
occurs within a narrow range of dopamine neurotransmission. Work in rodents has 
shown that exposure to nicotine during adolescence leads to nicotine withdrawal 
emergent alterations in cortical and subcortical dopamine neurotransmission.
OBJECTIVES: To test for evidence that the efficiency of neurocircuitry 
supporting working memory is altered during acute smoking abstinence in 
adolescent daily tobacco smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five adolescent daily tobacco smokers were compared 
with 38 nonsmokers using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects 
performed a verbal working memory task. Smokers were studied during smoking and 
after 24 h of abstinence from tobacco use.
RESULTS: Performance of a task with high working memory load in the context of 
smoking abstinence was associated with greater activation of components of the 
verbal working memory neurocircuit, including left ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex and left inferior parietal lobe, among smokers relative to nonsmokers. 
During smoking abstinence, smokers failed to exhibit increases in functional 
connectivity between components of the working memory neurocircuit with 
increasing working memory load observed in nonsmoking adolescents and in prior 
studies of adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking abstinence in adolescent smokers is associated with 
reductions in the efficiency of working memory neurocircuitry and alterations in 
the functional coordination between components of the working memory 
neurocircuit. These alterations may stem from effects of nicotine exposure on 
catecholaminergic systems during adolescent development.

Brain areas coactivating with motor cortex during chronic motor tics and 
intentional movements.

Haven, CT 06520-8043, USA. michelle.hampson@yale.edu

BACKGROUND: Chronic tic disorders are characterized by motor tics that are often 
preceded by premonitory urges to tic. Functional neuroimaging studies have 
documented brain activity patterns prior to and during tics, but these studies 
have not examined whether the activation patterns differ from those seen in 
normal control subjects performing similar acts.
METHODS: A novel method was used to compare brain patterns during tics and 
intentional movements. First, the part of motor cortex specific to each 
patient's tic movement was identified. The brain areas activating prior to, 
during, and after that part of motor cortex during tics were then identified by 
temporally cross-correlating the time course of the localized motor region with 
activity in other brain areas. Given that motor cortex was active during tic 
execution, this yielded information regarding the brain areas active prior to, 
during, and after the movements. The spatiotemporal pattern of coactivation with 
motor cortex during tics was contrasted with that seen in healthy control 
subjects during intentional tic-like movements.
RESULTS: Data from 16 adult subjects with tic disorders and 16 matched control 
subjects, who performed intentional movements similar to the patients' tics, 
revealed nearly identical patterns of cross-correlation to motor cortex 
throughout the brain in the two groups. However, the supplementary motor area 
showed a significantly broader profile of cross-correlation to motor cortex 
during tics than during intentional movements.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of the supplementary motor 
area in tic generation and may point toward novel intervention strategies for 
individuals suffering with severe tics.

Understanding the temporal dynamics of brain function contributes to models of 
learning and memory as well as the processing of emotions and habituation. In 
this article, we present a novel analysis technique to investigate 
spatiotemporal patterns of activation in response to blocked presentations of 
emotional stimuli. We modeled three temporal response functions (TRFs), which 
were maximally sensitive to the onset, early or sustained temporal component of 
a given block type. This analysis technique was applied to a data set of 29 
subjects who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while responding to 
fearful, happy, and sad facial expressions. We identified brain regions that 
uniquely fit each of the three TRFs for each emotional condition and compared 
the results to the standard approach, which was based on the canonical 
hemodynamic response function. We found that voxels within the precuneus fit the 
onset TRF but did not fit the early or the sustained TRF in all the emotional 
conditions. On the other hand, voxels within the amygdala fit the sustained TRF, 
but not the onset or early TRF, during presentation of fearful stimuli, 
suggesting a spatiotemporal dissociation between these structures. This 
technique provides researchers with an additional tool in order to investigate 
the temporal dynamics of neural circuits.

Functional neuroimaging studies indicate that a primary marker of specific 
reading disability (RD) is reduced activation of left hemisphere (LH) posterior 
regions during performance of reading tasks. However, the severity of this 
disruption, and the extent to which these LH systems might be available for 
reading under any circumstances, is unclear at present. Experiment 1 examined 
the cortical effects of stimulus manipulations (frequency, imageability, 
consistency) that have known facilitative effects on reading performance for 
both nonimpaired (NI) and RD readers. Experiment 2 examined stimulus repetition, 
another facilitative variable, in an additional sample of adolescent NI and RD 
readers. For NI readers, factors that made words easier to process were 
associated with relatively reduced activation. For RD readers, facilitative 
factors resulted in increased activation in these same reading-related sites, 
suggesting that the LH reading circuitry in adolescent RD is poorly trained but 
not wholly disrupted.

Individual differences in brain response to emotional stimuli have previously 
been associated with gene variations within the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) genes. We recently reported that these two 
genes exhibit an additive effect, based on recordings of event-related 
potentials (ERPs) from individuals viewing emotional scenes. The current study 
was designed to replicate and extent this initial report in an independent study 
sample, and use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify 
specific neural loci that may mediate the 5-HTT-TPH2 additive effect. 
Furthermore, we sought to obtain convergent evidence for a gene-gene additive 
effect by collecting fMRI data from the same individuals engaged in two 
different cognitive-affective tasks, using emotional and neutral facial 
expressions and word stimuli. We found evidence for an additive effect of 
5-HTT-TPH2 genotype, which was most robust in the putamen, a region rich in both 
5-HTT and TPH2 protein, but was also observed in the amygdala at a less 
stringent threshold, and in other cortical regions. The additive effect was more 
robust effect for visuospatial than for verbal stimuli, and more robust for 
negatively than for positively valenced stimuli. These findings confirm and 
extend the additive effect of two critical genes in the serotonergic regulation 
of neural processing of affective stimuli, and identify the striatum as a 
critical site where is gene-gene regulation takes place.

Previous research has investigated the association of personality traits with 
brain activation in response to emotional stimuli. Our current research efforts 
are directed at understanding the temporal dynamics of networks of structures 
associated with particular personality traits, and gain insights into the 
functional contributions of more narrowly defined trait-facets that comprise 
these personality traits. To begin this process, we conducted a functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using an emotional attention task 
(emotional Stroop paradigm) and addressed the question whether individual 
differences in extraversion and its lower-level facets were associated with 
differences in activation, and in functional connectivity, of the anterior 
cingulate (AC) cortex. We replicated our earlier finding that extraversion was 
associated with increased AC activation to positive, relative to neutral, word 
stimuli, but now show that distinct facets of extraversion can account for this 
association. When analyzing for functional connectivity, we found that greater 
extraversion across individuals was associated with greater functional 
connectivity between the AC and the inferior parietal lobule, and that this 
association could also be accounted for by distinct facets of extraversion. Our 
data suggest that extraversion and some of its lower-level facets are associated 
with individual differences across a network of structures believed to be 
critical in cognitive and affective processing.

OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the morphology and function of two gray matter 
structures central to emotional processing, the perigenual anterior cingulate 
cortex (pACC) and amygdala, have consistently been reported in bipolar disorder 
(BD). Evidence implicates abnormalities in their connectivity in BD. This study 
investigates the potential disruptions in pACC-amygdala functional connectivity 
and associated abnormalities in white matter that provides structural 
connections between the two brain regions in BD.
METHODS: Thirty-three individuals with BD and 31 healthy comparison subjects 
(HC) participated in a scanning session during which functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) during processing of face stimuli and diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) were performed. The strength of pACC-amygdala functional 
connections was compared between BD and HC groups, and associations between 
these functional connectivity measures from the fMRI scans and regional 
fractional anisotropy (FA) from the DTI scans were assessed.
RESULTS: Functional connectivity was decreased between the pACC and amygdala in 
the BD group compared with HC group, during the processing of fearful and happy 
faces (p < .005). Moreover, a significant positive association between 
pACC-amygdala functional coupling and FA in ventrofrontal white matter, 
including the region of the uncinate fasciculus, was identified (p < .005).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for abnormalities in pACC-amygdala 
functional connectivity during emotional processing in BD. The significant 
association between pACC-amygdala functional connectivity and the structural 
integrity of white matter that contains pACC-amygdala connections suggest that 
disruptions in white matter connectivity may contribute to disturbances in the 
coordinated responses of the pACC and amygdala during emotional processing in 
BD.

Interest in understanding the organization of the brain has led to the 
application of graph theory methods across a wide array of functional 
connectivity studies. The fundamental basis of a graph is the node. Recent work 
has shown that functional nodes reconfigure with brain state. To date, all graph 
theory studies of functional connectivity in the brain have used fixed nodes. 
Here, using fixed-, group-, state-specific, and individualized- parcellations 
for defining nodes, we demonstrate that functional connectivity changes within 
the nodes significantly influence the findings at the network level. In some 
cases, state- or group-dependent changes of the sort typically reported do not 
persist, while in others, changes are only observed when node reconfigurations 
are considered. The findings suggest that graph theory investigations into 
connectivity contrasts between brain states and/or groups should consider the 
influence of voxel-level changes that lead to node reconfigurations; the 
fundamental building block of a graph.

OBJECTIVES: To more precisely examine regional and subregional microstructural 
brain changes associated with preterm birth.
STUDY DESIGN: We obtained brain volumes from 29 preterm children, age 12 years, 
with no ultrasound scanning evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage or cystic 
periventricular leukomalacia in the newborn period, and 22 age- and sex-matched 
term control subjects.
RESULTS: Preterm male subjects demonstrated significantly lower white matter 
volumes in bilateral cingulum, corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, prefrontal 
cortex, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi compared with term male 
subjects. Gray matter volumes in prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal 
lobe also were significantly reduced in preterm male subjects. Brain volumes of 
preterm female subjects were not significantly different from those of term 
female control subjects. Voxel-based morphometry results were not correlated 
with perinatal variables or cognitive outcome. Higher maternal education was 
associated with higher cognitive performance in preterm male subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm male children continue to demonstrate abnormal 
neurodevelopment at 12 years of age. However, brain morphology in preterm female 
children may no longer differ from that of term female children. The 
neurodevelopmental abnormalities we detected in preterm male subjects appear to 
be relatively diffuse, involving multiple neural systems. The relationship 
between aberrant neurodevelopment and perinatal variables may be mediated by 
genetic factors, environmental factors, or both reflected in maternal education 
level.

BACKGROUND: Comparing prefrontal cortical activity during particular phases of 
working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia 
might help to define the phase-specific deficits in cortical function that 
contribute to cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. This study 
featured a spatial working memory task, similar to that used in nonhuman 
primates, that was designed to facilitate separating brain activation into 
encoding, maintenance, and response phases.
METHODS: Fourteen patients with schizophrenia (4 medication-free) and 12 healthy 
comparison participants completed functional magnetic resonance imaging while 
performing a spatial working memory task with two levels of memory load.
RESULTS: Task accuracy was similar in patients and healthy participants. 
However, patients showed reductions in brain activation during maintenance and 
response phases but not during the encoding phase. The reduced prefrontal 
activity during the maintenance phase of working memory was attributed to a 
greater rate of decay of prefrontal activity over time in patients. Cortical 
deficits in patients did not appear to be related to antipsychotic treatment. In 
patients and in healthy subjects, the time-dependent reduction in prefrontal 
activity during working memory maintenance correlated with poorer performance on 
the memory task.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data highlight that basic research insights into the 
distinct neurobiologies of the maintenance and response phases of working memory 
are of potential importance for understanding the neurobiology of cognitive 
impairment in schizophrenia and advancing its treatment.

Stop the sadness: Neuroticism is associated with sustained medial prefrontal 
cortex response to emotional facial expressions.

Neuroticism is a personality trait associated with negative mood states, 
sensitivity to negative information, negative appraisal and vulnerability to 
psychopathology. Previous studies have associated the sustained processing of 
negative information (words) with individual differences such as rumination and 
depression but not with personality. In the current study, we aimed to 
investigate the relationship between neuroticism and changes in sustained 
patterns of activity within a brain region implicated in emotional 
self-evaluation and appraisal, the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MedPFC), when 
responding to emotional facial expressions (happy, fearful, and sad). We tested 
whether higher scores of neuroticism are associated with greater sustained 
patterns of brain activity in the MedPFC when responding to blocks of negative 
facial expressions. We found that higher scores of neuroticism were associated 
with greater sustained MedPFC activity throughout blocks of sad facial 
expressions, but not fearful or happy facial expressions. Based on the 
relationship between neuroticism and sensitivity to negative information, the 
current finding identifies a sustained temporal mechanism to this relationship.

This paper presents a new and general nonlinear framework for fMRI data analysis 
based on statistical learning methodology: support vector machines. Unlike most 
current methods which assume a linear model for simplicity, the estimation and 
analysis of fMRI signal within the proposed framework is nonlinear, which 
matches recent findings on the dynamics underlying neural activity and 
hemodynamic physiology. The approach utilizes spatio-temporal support vector 
regression (SVR), within which the intrinsic spatio-temporal autocorrelations in 
fMRI data are reflected. The novel formulation of the problem allows merging 
model-driven with data-driven methods, and therefore unifies these two currently 
separate modes of fMRI analysis. In addition, multiresolution signal analysis is 
achieved and developed. Other advantages of the approach are: avoidance of 
interpolation after motion estimation, embedded removal of low-frequency noise 
components, and easy incorporation of multi-run, multi-subject, and multi-task 
studies into the framework.

A range of early circumstances surrounding the birth of a child affects 
peripartum hormones, parental behavior and infant wellbeing. One of these 
factors, which may lead to postpartum depression, is the mode of delivery: 
vaginal delivery (VD) or cesarean section delivery (CSD). To test the hypothesis 
that CSD mothers would be less responsive to own baby-cry stimuli than VD 
mothers in the immediate postpartum period, we conducted functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, 2-4 weeks after delivery, of the brains of six mothers who 
delivered vaginally and six who had an elective CSD. VD mothers' brains were 
significantly more responsive than CSD mothers' brains to their own baby-cry in 
the superior and middle temporal gyri, superior frontal gyrus, medial fusiform 
gyrus, superior parietal lobe, as well as regions of the caudate, thalamus, 
hypothalamus, amygdala and pons. Also, within preferentially active regions of 
VD brains, there were correlations across all 12 mothers with out-of-magnet 
variables. These include correlations between own baby-cry responses in the left 
and right lenticular nuclei and parental preoccupations (r = .64, p < .05 and 
.67, p < .05 respectively), as well as in the superior frontal cortex and Beck 
depression inventory (r = .78, p < .01). First this suggests that VD mothers are 
more sensitive to own baby-cry than CSD mothers in the early postpartum in 
sensory processing, empathy, arousal, motivation, reward and habit-regulation 
circuits. Second, independent of mode of delivery, parental worries and mood are 
related to specific brain activations in response to own baby-cry.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine gender differences in 
the neural correlates of response inhibition during a stop signal task. The task 
has a frequent "go" signal to set up a pre-potent response tendency and a less 
frequent "stop" signal for subjects to withhold their response. A contrast in 
brain activation was made between successful and failed inhibitions for 
individual subjects. We compared 20 men and 20 women matched in age and years of 
education and in stop signal performance, with stop success rate, post-error 
slowing and task-related frustration ratings as covariates. The results showed 
greater activation in men, compared to women, in a wide array of cortical and 
subcortical areas, including the globus pallidus and motor thalamus during stop 
signal inhibition. In contrast, no brain regions demonstrated greater activation 
in women, even at a lower statistical threshold. Moreover, while men activated 
the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate cortices, women activated the 
caudate tail to mediate response inhibition. These results extended gender 
differences in regional brain activation to response inhibition during a 
cognitive motor task. Men activated the motor circuitry while women appeared to 
involve visual association or habit learning during stop signal performance.

OBJECTIVE: Although preterm very low birth weight infants have a high prevalence 
of neuroanatomical abnormalities when evaluated at term-equivalent age, patterns 
of brain growth in prematurely born infants during school age and adolescence 
remain largely unknown. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that preterm birth 
results in long-term dynamic changes in the developing brain.
METHODS: We performed serial volumetric MRI studies at ages 8 and 12 years in 55 
preterm infants born weighing 600 to 1250 g and 20 term control children who 
participated in the follow-up component of a prospective, randomized, 
placebo-controlled intraventricular hemorrhage prevention study.
RESULTS: Total brain volumes increased 2% to 3% between the ages of 8 and 12 
years for both preterm and term children. These changes involved reductions in 
cerebral gray matter while white matter increased. Between 8 and 12 years of 
age, preterm subjects experienced a 2% decrease in left cerebral gray matter 
compared with a 10% reduction in left cerebral gray for term controls. For right 
cerebral gray matter, preterm children experienced a 3% decrease in volume 
between years 8 and 12, compared with 9% for term controls (group-by-time). In 
contrast, preterm subjects had a 10% increase in cerebral white matter volumes 
bilaterally between ages 8 and 12 years, compared with >26% increases for both 
hemispheres for term controls. Significant differences in regional volume 
changes between study groups were found in bilateral temporal gray and in 
parietal white matter.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth continues to perturb the trajectory of cerebral 
development during late childhood and early adolescence with preterm children, 
showing both lower gray matter reduction and less white matter gain over time 
compared with term control subjects.

BACKGROUND: Evaluation of lymphedema and lymph node metastasis in humans has 
relied primarily on invasive or radioactive modalities. While noninvasive 
technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer the potential for 
true three-dimensional imaging of lymphatic structures, invasive modalities, 
such as optical fluorescence microscopy, provide higher resolution and clearer 
delineation of both lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels. Thus, contrast agents 
that image lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes by both fluorescence and MRI may 
further enhance our understanding of the structure and function of the lymphatic 
system. Recent applications of bimodal (fluorescence and MR) contrast agents in 
mice have not achieved clear visualization of lymphatic vessels and nodes. Here 
the authors describe the development of a nanoparticulate contrast agent that is 
taken up by lymphatic vessels to draining lymph nodes and detected by both 
modalities.
METHODS: A unique nanoparticulate contrast agent composed of a polyamidoamine 
dendrimer core conjugated to paramagnetic contrast agents and fluorescent probes 
was synthesized. Anesthetized mice were injected with the nanoparticulates in 
the hind footpads and imaged by MR and fluorescence microscopy. High resolution 
MR and fluorescence images were obtained and compared to traditional techniques 
for lymphatic visualization using Evans blue dye.
RESULTS: Lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels were clearly observed by both MRI and 
fluorescence microscopy using the bimodal nanoparticulate contrast agent. 
Characteristic tail-lymphatics were also visualized by both modalities. Contrast 
imaging yielded a higher resolution than the traditional method employing Evans 
blue dye. MR data correlated with fluorescence and Evans blue dye imaging.
CONCLUSION: A bimodal nanoparticulate contrast agent facilitates the 
visualization of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes by both fluorescence 
microscopy and MRI with strong correlation between the two modalities. This 
agent may translate to applications such as the assessment of malignancy and 
lymphedema in humans and the evaluation of lymphatic vessel function and 
morphology in animal models.

Determination of axonal pathways provides an invaluable means to study the 
connectivity of the human brain and its functional network. Diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) is unique in its ability to capture the restricted diffusion of 
water molecules which can be used to infer the directionality of tissue 
components. In this paper, we introduce a white matter tractography method based 
on anisotropic wavefront propagation in diffusion tensor images. A front 
propagates in the white matter with a speed profile governed by the isocontour 
of the diffusion tensor ellipsoid. By using the ellipsoid, we avoid possible 
misclassification of the principal eigenvector in oblate regions. The wavefront 
evolution is described by an anisotropic version of the static Hamilton-Jacobi 
equation, which is solved by a sweeping method in order to obtain correct 
arrival times. Pathways of connection are determined by tracing minimum-cost 
trajectories using the characteristic vector field of the resulting partial 
differential equation. A validity index is described to rate the goodness of the 
resulting pathways with respect to the directionality of the tensor field. 
Connectivity results using normal human DTI brain images are illustrated and 
discussed. We also compared our method with a similar level set-based 
tractography technique, and found that the anisotropic evolution increased the 
validity index of the obtained pathways by 18%.

The purpose of this experiment was to assess the effects of probe familiarity, 
the consequences of having recently retrieved an autobiographic memory (AM), on 
subsequent recall. This was accomplished by replicating an earlier imaging 
experiment, using the same participants and memory probes. Subtractions between 
sessions showed significant pre-exposure effects (i.e., drop in BOLD signal 
intensity) in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and other brain 
structures. Further, region of interest (ROI) analysis illustrated a significant 
decrease in neural activity in the hippocampus in both conditions. The results 
are discussed in terms of the pre-scan interview technique, a method applied in 
AM research to procure personal information. Although invaluable, we emphasize 
it must be used with caution as it can result in a loss of power. The widespread 
use of this method in AM research may explain why studies often fail to find 
evidence of significant responding in the hippocampus in response to memory 
probes. Alternatively, when activity in the hippocampus is reported, it often 
fails to differentiate between recent and remote memories. This point is of 
particular importance to the on-going consolidation debate, as it often centers 
on a failure to detect an effect in the hippocampus in one or both conditions.

Hepatic fat fraction (HFF) was measured in 28 lean/obese humans by single-voxel 
proton spectroscopy (MRS), a two-point Dixon (2PD), and a three-point iterative 
decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation 
(IDEAL) method (3PI). For the lean, obese, and total subject groups, the range 
of HFF measured by MRS was 0.3-3.5% (1.1 +/- 1.4%), 0.3-41.5% (11.7 +/- 12.1), 
and 0.3-41.5% (10.1 +/- 11.6%), respectively. For the same groups, the HFF 
measured by 2PD was -6.3-2.2% (-2.0 +/- 3.7%), -2.4-42.9% (12.9 +/- 13.8%), and 
-6.3-42.9% (10.5 +/- 13.7%), respectively, and for 3PI they were 7.9-12.8% (10.1 
+/- 2.0%), 11.1-49.3% (22.0 +/- 12.2%), and 7.9-49.3% (20.0 +/- 11.8%), 
respectively. The HFF measured by MRS was highly correlated with those measured 
by 2PD (r = 0.954, P < 0.001) and 3PI (r = 0.973, P < 0.001). With the MRS data 
as a reference, the percentages of correct differentiation between normal and 
fatty liver with the MRI methods ranged from 68-93% for 2PD and 64-89% for 3PI. 
Our study demonstrates that the apparent HFF measured by the MRI methods can 
significantly vary depending on the choice of water-fat separation methods and 
sequences. Such variability may limit the clinical application of the MRI 
methods, particularly when a diagnosis of early fatty liver needs to be 
performed. Therefore, protocol-specific establishment of cutoffs for liver fat 
content may be necessary.

A previous block-design fMRI study revealed deactivation in the hippocampus in 
the transverse patterning task, specifically designed, on the basis of lesion 
literature, to engage hippocampal information processing. In the current study, 
a mixed block/event-related design was used to determine the temporal nature of 
the signal change leading to the seemingly paradoxical deactivation. All 
positive activations in the hippocampal-dependent condition, relative to a 
closely matched control task, were seen to result from positive BOLD transients 
in the typical 4-7 s poststimulus time range. However, most deactivations, 
including in the hippocampus and in other "default mode" regions commonly 
deactivated in cognitive tasks, were attributable to enhanced negative transient 
signals in a later time range, 10-12 s. This late hemodynamic transient was most 
pronounced in medial prefrontal cortex. In some regions, the 
hippocampal-dependent condition enhanced both the early positive and late 
negative transients to approximately the same degree, resulting in no 
significant signal change when block analysis is used, despite very different 
event-related responses. These results imply that delayed negative transients 
can play a role in determining the presence and sign of brain activation in 
block-design studies, in which case an event-related analysis can be more 
sensitive than a block analysis, even if the different conditions occur within 
blocks. In this case, default mode deactivations are timelocked to stimulus 
presentation as much as positive activations are, but in a later time range, 
suggesting a specific role of negative transient signals in task performance.

fMRI was used to investigate the separate influences of orthographic, 
phonological, and semantic processing on the ability to learn new words and the 
cortical circuitry recruited to subsequently read those words. In a behavioral 
session, subjects acquired familiarity for three sets of pseudowords, attending 
to orthographic, phonological, or (learned) semantic features. Transfer effects 
were measured in an event-related fMRI session as the subjects named trained 
pseudowords, untrained pseudowords, and real words. Behaviorally, phonological 
and semantic training resulted in better learning than did orthographic 
training. Neurobiologically, orthographic training did not modulate activation 
in the main reading regions. Phonological and semantic training yielded 
equivalent behavioral facilitation but distinct functional activation patterns, 
suggesting that the learning resulting from these two training conditions was 
driven by different underlying processes. The findings indicate that the 
putative ventral visual word form area is sensitive to the phonological 
structure of words, with phonologically analytic processing contributing to the 
specialization of this region.
