   <hr>
<p>I’m Javid Dadashkarimi PhD candidate in computer science department at Yale University. I’m so grateful to work with Dustin Scheinost and Amin Karbasi in my PhD. Currently, I am interested in finding a mechanism to transfer human brain images between two locations.
Theoretically, I am using optimal transport to find out a transportation plan between fMRI images derived from different atlases (Yale, Oxford, Schaefer, Dosenbach, etc | kids vs adults). In addition, I am investigating why statistical methods outperform neural networks in functional MRI and trying to design graph neural network and variational AutoEncoders that don&rsquo;t collapse in such high dimensional data.</p>
<p>I started my reseach with machine translations (University of Tehran, Heshaam Faili 2012). In natural language processing lab I was trying to gather a huge amount of parallel data betwee English and Persian for our machine translation named <a href="https://www.faraazin.ir/">Faraazin</a>.
Then, I was introduced to IBM alignment models to find out translation probabilities between words based on expectation maximization algorithm.
While promissing, Persian is considered as a resource lean language and having these kind of aligned corpora is expensive.</p>
<p><img src="/images/translation.jpg" alt="Example"></p>
<p>In 2012 I decided to continue on a very basic problem named dictionary-based machine translation (University of Tehran, Azadeh Shakery, Heshaam Faili 2013).
Indeed, bilingual dictionaries are available for most pairs of languages and if you build a strong translation model sentence/query translation comes for free.
My collaboration with these two labs while I was taking advantage of my mentors&rsquo; brilliant advices ended up with several translation models are beeing used in multilingual search enginees.
A similar method to IBM models but now based on comparable corpora was proposed to over come ambiguity in multilingual search enginees (<a href="/publications/2017/imp-2017">IP&amp;M, 2016</a>).
A method based on ordinal linear regression was proposed for long sentence translations (<a href="/publications/2016/cikm-2016">COLING, 2016</a>) and finally a shining matrix factorization technique was proposed for general retrieval systems to unpack the user specified query with new related words (<a href="">CIKM, 2016</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/images/google.jpg" alt="Example"></p>
<p>Yet, I had a failed project: In 2015 I was going to map brain signals derived from Electroencephalogram between individuals spearking English and Persian joint with cognitive neuroscience lab. This project didn&rsquo;t go through well due to limited rosources and time. But, I got back to it 4 years later which I will explain in a bit.</p>
<p>Once I started my PhD at Yale University (2017-2018 PhD fellowhipg) I continued working on natural language processing again (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vIqWvgwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dragomir Radev</a>).
I was involved with a huge multilingual search engine project joint with Columbia University (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ujDhg2sAAAAJ">Kathleen McKeown</a>), University of Maryland (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=3ctKkysAAAAJ">Douglas W. Oard</a>), and Edinburgh University. In 2018 I continued my PhD as research assistant supported by a huge grant from National University of Health which will explain soon.</p>
<p>In 2018 I tried for the second time to understand human brain mechanism, specially in language, vision, and intelligence.
This project was pure success for me since Yale magnetic resonance research center was hosting a large number of fMRI scanners including 3 Tesla Prisma and animal scnners with a huge multidisciplinary team including computer scientistis, electrical engineerings, physicians, neuroscientists, and psychologists (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=qx5IhAQAAAAJ">Todd Constable</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oa8M4LoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dustin Scheinost</a>, 2017).</p>
<p><img src="/images/scanner-bio.jpg" alt="Example"></p>
<p>Once I convinced Dustin about my plan I continued my PhD in Yale&rsquo;s MRRC with him (Yale Radiology Department) and Amin Karbasi (Computer Science, Yale University) under National Institute of Health, Brain Initiative (<a href="https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/">BioImage Suit Web, R24 MH114805</a>).
At the beginning I was involved in a huge web-based brain imaging project to develp tools for preprocessing and visualizing brain&rsquo;s complex networks.
Again my tight collaboration with computer science department under supervision of Amin Karbasi helped me to introduce optimal transport to functional brain imaging as a new way of transfering brain activity from one atlas to another.
Then, a powerful method was introduced to reconstruct high resoloution images from low resoloution ones and vice versa using optimal transport and Sinkhorn approximation (<a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/data-driven-mapping-between-functional-connectomes-using-optimal/19691876">MICCAI, 2021</a>).
In this project, we approximate the functional mappings of the individuals without involving additional preprocessing steps. Indeed due to time constraints, storage issues, or privacy concerns that may lead to inaccessiblity of raw data, this method is a unique replacement.</p>
<p><img src="/images/preprocessing.jpg" alt="Example">
An now, we are working on the extention of the project specifically on multiple atlases and different tasks.
The method is ready to be used for example with Yale&rsquo;s Shen atlas and generate Dosenbach, Power, Craddock, and Schaefer atlases and vice versa.
Therefore, without need for preprocessing steps at the beginning, the generated brain mappings achieves comparable results to the preprocessed data in downstream analysis (e.g., fluid intelligence prediction).</p>
<p>All together, here I am providing my academic trajectory that is representing people and labs that had notable impact on my academic career so far.</p>
